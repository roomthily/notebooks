This study presents the first bomb radiocarbon reference chronology for the CC and petrale sole age validation. Break-and-burn and surface ages are negatively biased by approximately 1 year and 2-3 years, respectively. Compared to previous studies, the reference and validation curves are more variable and show a lag in the rate of radiocarbon increase during the informative years of bomb radiocarbon increase in marine systems. Upwelling in the CC produces a later onset and slower rate of increase in radiocarbon levels due to the introduction and mixing of radiocarbon-depleted deep waters with surface waters that interact with the atmosphere. The variable and lagged rate of radiocarbon increase in the petrale sole data may be due to a substantial portion of the first year of life spent in areas subject to variable upwelling, illustrating the importance of using reference curves for age validation that are region- and species-specific when possible. Otolith ages and bomb radiocarbon assays.To support NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program (CRCP) long-term goals for sustainable management and conservation of coral reef ecosystems, towed-diver surveys (aka. towboard surveys) were conducted by the Coral Reef Ecosystem Division (CRED) of the NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC) as part of biennial Pacific Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program (RAMP) Cruises. 19 towboard surveys (46.2630 km in length), were conducted at Wake Island during the Pacific Remote Island Areas RAMP Cruise HI0701 from 19 April - 9 May 2007. Towboard surveys are a good method for obtaining a general description of large reef areas, assessing the status of low-density populations of large-bodied reef fish, large-scale disturbances (e.g., bleaching), general distribution and abundance patterns of macro-invertebrates (e.g., COT, giant clams), and for assessing trends in these populations and metrics. A pair of scuba divers (1 fish and 1 benthic diver) are towed 60 m behind a small survey launch at a speed of 1-2 knots and a depth of approximately 15m. Each survey is 50 min long, covers about 2 km of habitat, and is divided into ten 5-minute survey segments. The fish diver records, to the lowest possible taxon, all large-bodied reef fishes (>50cmTL) seen within 5m either side and 10m in front of the towboard. Length of each individual is estimated to the nearest cm. The fish towboard is also outfitted with a forward-facing digital video camera to record the survey swath. The benthic diver records percent cover of coral and macroalgae, estimates benthic habitat type and complexity, and censuses a suite of benthic macroinvertebrates including Crown of Thorns sea stars and sea urchins. The benthic towboard is equipped with a downward-facing digital still camera which images the benthos at 15 second intervals. These images are analyzed for percent cover of coral, algae, and other benthic components. Both towboards are equipped with SEABIRD SBE-39 temperature/depth sensors set to record at 5 second intervals. Latitude and longitude of each survey track is recorded at 15 second intervals using a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver onboard the tow boat. A layback algorithm is applied to more accurately map the position of the divers with respect to the reef environment. This algorithm calculates the position of the divers based on the position of the tow boat taking into account the length of the tow rope, the depth of the divers, and the curvature of the survey track. This metadata applies to the benthic characterization observations.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

NEXRAD is a network of 160 high-resolution Doppler weather radars operated by the NOAA National Weather Service (NWS), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and the U.S. Air Force (USAF). Doppler radars detect atmospheric precipitation and winds, which allow scientists to track and anticipate weather events, such as rain, ice pellets, snow, hail, and tornadoes, as well as some non-weather objects like birds and insects. NEXRAD stations use the Weather Surveillance Radar - 1988, Doppler (WSR-88D) system. This is a 10 cm wavelength (S-Band) radar that operates at a frequency between 2,700 and 3,000 MHz. The radar system operates in two basic modes: a slow-scanning Clear Air Mode (Mode B) for analyzing air movements when there is little or no precipitation activity in the area, and a Precipitation Mode (Mode A) with a faster scan for tracking active weather. The two modes employ nine Volume Coverage Patterns (VCPs) to adequately sample the atmosphere based on weather conditions. A VCP is a series of 360 degree sweeps of the antenna at pre-determined elevation angles and pulse repetition frequencies completed in a specified period of time. The radar scan times 4.5, 5, 6 or 10 minutes depending on the selected VCP. During 2008, the WSR-88D radars were upgraded to produce increased spatial resolution data, called Super Resolution. The earlier Legacy Resolution data provides radar reflectivity at 1.0 degree azimuthal by 1 km range gate resolution to a range of 460 km, and Doppler velocity and spectrum width at 1.0 degree azimuthal by 250 m range gate resolution to a range of 230 km. The upgraded Super Resolution data provides radar reflectivity at 0.5 degree azimuthal by 250 m range gate resolution to a range of 460 km, and Doppler velocity and spectrum width at 0.5 degree azimuthal by 250 m range gate resolution to a range of 300 km. Super resolution makes a compromise of slightly decreased noise reduction for a large gain in resolution. In 2010, the deployment of the Dual Polarization (Dual Pol) capability to NEXRAD sites began with the first operational Dual Pol radar in May 2011. Dual Pol radar capability adds vertical polarization to the previous horizontal radar waves, in order to more accurately discern the return signal. This allows the radar to better distinguish between types of precipitation (e.g., rain, hail and snow), improves rainfall estimates, improves data retrieval in mountainous terrain, and aids in removal of non-weather artifacts. The NEXRAD products are divided in two data processing levels. The lower Level II data are base products at original resolution. Level II data are recorded at all NWS and most USAF and FAA WSR-88D sites. From the Level II quantities, computer processing generates numerous meteorological analysis Level III products. The Level III data consists of reduced resolution, low-bandwidth, base products as well as many derived, post-processed products. Level III products are recorded at most U.S. sites, though non-US sites do not have Level III products. There are over 40 Level III products available from the NCDC. General products for Level III include the base and composite reflectivity, storm relative velocity, vertical integrated liquid, echo tops and VAD wind profile. Precipitation products for Level III include estimated ground accumulated rainfall amounts for one and three hour periods, storm totals, and digital arrays. Estimates are based on reflectivity to rainfall rate (Z-R) relationships. Overlay products for Level III are alphanumeric data that give detailed information on certain parameters for an identified storm cell. These include storm structure, hail index, mesocyclone identification, tornadic vortex signature, and storm tracking information. Radar messages for Level III are sent by the radar site to users in order to know more about the radar status and special product data. NEXRAD data are provided to the NOAA National Climatic Data Center for archiving and dissemination to users. Data coverage varies by station and ranges from May 1992 to 1 day from present. Most stations began observing in the mid-1990s, and most period of records are continuous.Links to grassland bird species with detailed descriptions and bibliographic database in *.zip files to download in ProCite 5, Rich Text Format or ASCII formats.This map displays optical validation observation locations and percent coverage of scleractinian coral overlaid on bathymetry.Residential Life, ResLifepostdoctoral,U.S.,profession,npa,research,researchers,science,enterprise,postdocs,community, nonprofit, stemPacific Science Center inspires a lifelong interest in science, math and technology by engaging diverse communities through interactive and innovative exhibits and programs.All recreationally caught billfish and swordfish that are landed outside of a registered tournament must be reported to the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS).

The computationused about 1.8 million terrestrial and marine gravity data held in the National Geodetic Survey gravity data base in July 1996. These data were augmented by gravity data contributions from NGA (former National Imagery and Mapping Agency (former Defence Mapping Agency)). The deflections were obtained by numerical differentiation of cubic spline models along the meridians of the GEOID96 grid. The gravity values are based on theInternational Gravity Standardization Net 1971 (IGSN71). The deflections are referred to the Geodetic Reference System 1980 (GRS80) ellipsoidal normals. The deflections of the vertical incorporate the reference system relationship between NAD 83(86) and ITRF94(1996.0), the datum offset of NAVD 88, and thecontributions from 2951 GPS on leveled benchmarks.

The primary IFSAR dataset was acquired by Intermap Technologies and contracted by the Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Geological Survey, and the National Science Foundation. The raw data were collected with a STAR-3i airborne synthetic aperture radar system, a high-resolution, single pass, across track IfSAR system (Intermap, 2010). The Digital Surface Model (DSM) products represent the first reflective surface as illuminated by the radar. The STAR-3i system is capable of acquiring imagery with a horizontal accuracy better than 2 m, a vertical accuracy better than 1 m, and a vertical resolution on the order of 0.1 m (Intermap, 2010). Accuracy statements are based on areas of moderate terrain. Diminished accuracies are to be expected in areas of extreme terrain and dense vegetation. In addition, the DSM contains processing artifacts expressing as 30 to 50 cm high ripples or 'corn rows' that should be considered additional vertical error in the dataset. This striping results from uncompensated differential phase errors on very flat terrain. In addition, users will notice a seam line separating the tiles that were provided in UTM zone 5 with those provided in UTM zone 4. The differences along the seamline is within the 1m vertical accuracy of the dataset butthe variability is apparent here. The DSM data for 7.5-minute by 18-minute units correspond to the USGS 1:63,360 scale topographic quadrangle map series for available areas in the United States. Each 7.5-minute by 18-minute tile provides full coverage with overlap into adjacent tiles. The mosaic consists of 312 tiles. The mosaic was created using the software package Global Mapper and exported as an Erdas Imagine image file.

Cell values reflect the surface area and (surface area) / (planimetric area) ratio for the area contained within that cell's boundaries. They provide indices of topographic roughness & convolutedness. This data set is for the bank top and lagoon environments of Kure Atoll, Hawaii, USA.This project is a cooperative effort among the National Ocean Service, National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science, Center for Coastal Monitoring and Assessment; the University of Hawaii; and Analytical Laboratories of Hawaii, LLC. IKONOS imagery was purchased to support the Pacific Islands Geographic Information System (GIS) project and the National Ocean Service's (NOS) coral mapping activities. One-meter panchromatic and four-meter multi-spectral data were purchased for each study area. The enhanced spectral resolution of multispectral imagery and control of bandwidths of multispectral data yield an advantage over color aerial photography particularly when coral health and time series analysis of coral reef community structure are of interest. The IKONOS imagery was processed to minimize atmospheric and water column effects. Photointerpreters can accurately and reliably delineate boundaries of features in the imagery as they appear on the computer monitor using a software interface such as the Habitat Digitizer.WMSReports, data, and current research on mineral resources in AlaskaThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

The project is a cooperative effort between investigators at the NOAA National Geophysical Data Center's Marine Geology & Geophysics Division (NGDC/MGG) and the NOAA Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL). was compiled utilizing the entire historic sounding data base. This bathymetry resolves physiography of the lake floor to an extent that known features are revealed more accurately and features never before seen are revealed for the first time. Bathymetry has been compiled using the entire array of good-quality historical hydrographic soundings collected in support of nautical charting over a 120-year period by the NOAA National Ocean Service and its predecessor agency for Great Lakes surveying, the Army Corps of Engineers. More than 600,000 bathymetric soundings were employed, of which approximately 60 per cent were already in digital form, 25 per cent were digitized in conjunction with this effort, and the remaining 15 per cent were available only on paper survey sheets. Bathymetry was compiled at a scale of 1:250,000, with a contour interval of 5 meters. Density of tracklines is generally about 2000m for the open lake and ranges from 200m to 600m for nearshore areas. Soundings collected since 1903 were already reduced to the Lake Michigan mean low water datum; these were used for bathymetric contouring without further calibration or adjustments. Soundings collected prior to 1903 were reduced to the mean low water datum. In preparation for bathymetric contouring, digital soundings were converted to metric units and plotted in color; separate colors were assigned to the various depth ranges. From the paper sheets, contours in metric units were generated directly on overlays; these contours were then reduced to the compilation scale of 1:250,000 and incorporated into the map. Compilation sheets were then scanned and vectorized; and the resulting digital vector bathymetric contour data were used to generate the imagery shown on the large color plate. Images were constructed using the publicly-available software Generic Mapping Tools (GMT).Provides standards and guidance for measuring, estimating, collecting, and analyzing water-use data.

Each of these global data sets was created from the primary Landsat sensor in use at the time for those periods of time: the Multispectral Scanner in the 1970s, the Thematic Mapper (TM) in 1990's, and the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) combined with TM data in 2000, 2005, and 2010. Direct downlink to a ground station was the only way to acquire Landsat 5 TM data, because unlike Landsat 7, the Landsat 5 satellite did not have an onboard solid-state recorder. To obtain Landsat 5 TM imagery for areas outside the United States, the USGS negotiated agreements with ground stations around the globe to downlink and send data to USGS. These agreements made thousands of additional Landsat 5 TM scenes available for GLS consideration. The GLS datasets are scene-based. Other decadal mosaics are available in the Landsat Legacy collections.WFS Service for RGIS dataset National Park Boundaries (7bbe8af5-029b-4adf-b06c-134f0dd57226)Search tool for locating print and online U.S. geologic maps by area, title, author, etc.This database contains weekly reports submitted by herring vessels with IVR reporting requirements.WMSThese photographs were taken by Gemini mission astronauts with handheld cameras or by the Large Format Camera (LFC) that flew on space shuttle Challenger in October 1984.Library Catalog may include: Data Management Plans, Cruise Plans, Cruise Summary Reports, Scientific "Quick Look Reports", Video Annotation Logs, Image Collections, Highlight Images, Video Collections, Highlight Video Clips, Dive Plans, Dive Summary Reports, Maps, Essays, News Articles, Presentations, Education Lesson Plans, Biographies, Web Logs/Summaries.USGS water resources home page for Idaho with links to detailed hydrologic studies and real-time and long-term data on streamflow, ground and surface water, water quality, and water use, plus drought watch and relevant publications.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

An orthoimage is remotely sensed image data in which displacement of features in the image caused by terrain relief and sensor orientation have been mathematically removed. Orthoimagery combines the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map. Each orthoimage provides imagery over a 5000-foot by 5000-foot block on the ground. There is no image overlap between adjacent files. The projected coordinate system is Georgia State Plane West (FIPS 1002) feet with a NAD83 datum.This dataset replaces the previous Time Bias Corrected Divisional Temperature-Precipitation Drought Index. The new divisional data set (nCLIMDIV) is based on the Global Historical Climatological Network-Daily (GHCN-D) and makes use of several improvements to the previous data set. For the input data, improvements include additional station networks, quality assurance reviews and temperature bias adjustments. Perhaps the most extensive improvement is to the computational approach, which now employs climatologically aided interpolation. This 5km grid based calculation nCLIMGRID helps to address topographic and network variability. This data set is primarily used by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) to issue State of the Climate Reports on a monthly basis. These reports summarize recent temperature and precipitation conditions and long-term trends at a variety of spatial scales, the smallest being the climate division level. Data at the climate division level are aggregated to compute statewide, regional and national snapshots of climate conditions. For CONUS, the period of record is from 1895-present. Derived quantities such as Standardized precipitation Index (SPI), Palmer Drought Indices (PDSI, PHDI, PMDI, and ZNDX) and degree days are also available for the CONUS sites. In March 2015, data for thirteen Alaskan climate divisions were added to the nCLIMDIV data set. Data for the new Alaskan climate divisions begin in 1925 through the present and are included in all nCLIMDIV monthly updates. Alaskan climate data include the following elements for divisional and statewide coverage: average temperature, maximum temperature (highs), minimum temperature (lows), and precipitation. The Alaska nCLIMDIV data were created and updated using similar methodology as that for the CONUS, but with a different approach to establishing the underlying climatology. The Alaska data are built upon the 1971-2000 PRISM averages whereas the CONUS values utilize a base climatology derived from the nCLIMGRID data set.Lead page for detailed United States surface water information with links to real-time and historic streamflow data, suspended sediment data, USGS programs and facilities, publications, techniques, and featured news releases.These are the impaired streams as determined by MPCA in 2004.

The High Plains aquifer underlies 112.6 million acres (176,000 square miles) in parts of eight States: Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming. The aquifer's saturated thickness ranges from near zero to about 1,200 feet (Weeks and Gutentag, 1981). Water-level declines occurred in parts of the High Plains aquifer soon after the onset of substantial irrigation with groundwater (about 1950) (Luckey and others, 1981; Gutentag and others, 1984). This data set was generated in ESRI ArcInfo Workstation Version 9.3, which is a geographic information system (GIS), using water-level-change data from wells measured in 1980 and 1995 and from some additional wells in New Mexico, which were measured in 1996 and 1997. For this data set, areas of no substantial change were designated as areas where water-level change was between a rise of 3 feet and and decline of 3 feet; the raster was set to zero in the areas of no substantial change.

For example, research indicates surficial sediments affect the distribution and abundance of many groundfish species, yet traditional sampling with grabs and cores is impractical over areas as large as the Bering Sea shelf. Acoustic tools are suitable for large-scale surveying and show great promise as a substitute for direct-sampling methods, but they have not been proven useful for EFH purposes.Information on mineral deposits containing rare earth elements from around the world with grade and tonnage, and mineralogy.OHDR has published Railroads in Liberia as of 2007 on their website in support of the Ebola crisis.We assembled 2.1 million National Ocean Service (NOS) bathymetric soundings extending 1,900 km along the Aleutian Islands from Unimak Island in the east to the Russian border in the west, and ranging approximately 500 km north of the central Aleutians to Petrel and Bowers Banks, and also the surrounding deep waters of the southeastern Bering Sea. These bathymetry data are available from the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC: http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov), which archives and distributes data that were originally collected by the NOS and others. While various bathymetry data have been downloaded previously from NGDC, compiled, and used for a variety of projects, our effort differed in that we compared and corrected the digital bathymetry by studying the original analog source documents - digital versions of the original survey maps, called smooth sheets. Our editing included deleting erroneous and superseded values, digitizing missing values, and properly aligning all data sets to a common, modern datum. We also digitized 25,000 verbal surficial sediment descriptions from the smooth sheets, providing the largest single source of sediment information for the Aleutians.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

During the cruise, there were 23 surveys in total conducted at REA sites around Saipan Island in the Marianas Archipelago. At the specific REA sites, coral biologists along with fish biologists, algal biologists and marine invertebrate zoologist entered the water and conducted a fine-scale (~300 m2) and high degree of taxonomic resolution REA survey to assess and monitor species composition, abundance, percent cover, size distribution, diversity, and general health of fish, corals, macro-invertebrates, and algae in shallow-water (< 35 m) habitats. As a part of REA surveys, the coral belt surveys were focused on quantifying the diversity, abundance, density, and size-class distribution of the anthozoan and hydrozoan corals as well as the condition and health state of the coral reef populations. The surveys were conducted along two consecutively-placed, 25m transect lines. The belt width was dictated at the beginning of each dive by subjective perceived colony density: 1-m width was used in high density areas, while 2-m width was used in low density areas. Within each 25m transect, five 2.5-meter segments were surveyed (beginning at points: 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 meters), whereby in each segment, all coral colonies whose center fell within 0.5m of either side of the transect line were identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible (genus or species) and two planar size metrics were collected: maximum diameter and diameter perpendicular to the maximum diameter. In addition, the extent of mortality, both recent and old, was estimated for each colony. Observers paid special attention to identifying as best as possible the extent of the former live colony. When a coral colony exhibited signs of disease or compromised health, additional information was recorded including type of affliction (bleaching, skeletal growth anomaly, white syndrome, tissue loss other than white syndrome, trematodiasis, necrosis, other, pigmentation responses, algal overgrowth, and predation), severity of the affliction (mild, moderate, marked, severe, acute), as well as photographic documentation and sometimes tissue samples. Tissue samples were catalogued and fixed in buffered zinc-formalin solution for further histopathological analyses. Raw survey data included species presence and relative abundance, colony counts per taxon, size (width and length), mortality, predation, and health status. A surveyed area was ranging from 10m2 to 25m2 per site.The LLO operates in conjunction with the Limnological Research Center (LRC) in working towards fulfilling the objectives of the International Decade for the East African Lakes (IDEAL) to study the East African Lakes. The Lake Victoria project is funded by NSF. Like Lake Victoria, extensive work is being continued on Lake Malawi, Lake Turkana, and Lake Edward. In addition to the East African lakes, the LLO is working on Lake Issyk Kul', Lake Nicaragua, and Lake Superior. Summary: The Biogenic Silica Data file contains data for 5 cores taken from various sites in Lake Victoria. The data include ship, coring date, water depth, latitude/longitude, sampling device, sampled interval, % biogenic silica, and 14C dates. Cores were sampled at 10 cm intervals for biogenic silica analysis. Samples taken for 14C dating were prepared at the LRC Laboratory and sent to an outside AMS Facility for analysis. Pollen, charcoal, and plant macrofossils were dated. Biogenic Silica analysis was done using a timed, wet extraction technique adapted from D. J. DeMaster (1979). The analysis was done using 0.5 M NaOH at 85 0C.ISCB - International Society for Computational BiologyThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

The 1991-2010 NSRDB is an update of the 1991-2005 NSRDB released in 2006 and archived at NCDC. The serially complete hourly data provided in the NSRDB update are provided in two output formats: 1) ground-based solar and meteorological dataset, and 2) 10 km gridded output produced by the SUNY model. The 10 km gridded output is from the State University of New York/Albany (SUNY) satellite radiation model developed by Richard Perez and Clean Power Research. Data in the NSRDB are a slightly modified version of the SolarAnywhere dataset distributed by Clear Power Research. The modifications are detailed in the NSRDB User's Manual. The model uses hourly radiance images estimated from Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) imagery, daily snow cover data, and monthly averages of atmospheric water vapor, trace gases, and the amount of aerosols in the atmosphere to calculate the hourly total irradiance (sun and sky) falling on a horizontal surface. Atmospheric water vapor, trace gases, and aerosols are derived from a variety of sources. In simple terms, this satellite model uses the inverse relationship between reflected irradiance (that reflected by clouds and atmosphere back to space and the satellite sensor) and ground irradiance (that transmitted through the atmosphere to the Earth's surface). The high-resolution 10-km gridded data set from the SUNY model provides a consistency in modeled output data for its period of record for the years 1998 to 2009, the period for which necessary GOES imagery was available for the project. The SUNY model produces estimates of global and direct irradiance at hourly intervals on the 10-km grid for 49 states, excluding Alaska, where the geostationary satellites cannot resolve cloud cover with necessary detail. Although GOES images provide up to 1-km resolution, in the SUNY model, these data are down-sampled to 10-km resolution (0.1 degree x 0.1 degree). This resolution is adequate for most solar radiation resource applications and represents a practical trade-off between resolution and processing and data storage considerations. The model uses both GOES-East and GOES-West satellites for complete spatial coverage of the United States.The National Digital Forecast Database (NDFD) contains a seamless mosaic of the National Weather Service's (NWS) digital forecasts of precipitation amounts.

Such cruises are conducted at biennial intervals by the Coral Reef Ecosystem Division (CRED) at the NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC). At specific reef sites, marine invertebrate zoologists along with coral and algal biologists entered the water and conducted a fine-scale (~100 m2) and high degree of taxonomic resolution benthic REA survey for coral, algae, and key invertebrate species. Invertebrate surveys were focused on quantifying key non-coral invertebrate species common to the reef habitats, and were conducted using a combination of different survey techniques to quantify the diverse communities. These methods included belt-transect surveys, roving-swim surveys, and quadrat surveys. In belt-transect surveys, quantitative counts of key invertebrates were recorded along two consecutively-placed 25m long and 2m wide belt transects (total area = 100 m2). For any species that cannot be identified in the field, a photograph and a representative specimen, if possible, is collected for later identification. Roving-swim surveys were conducted in the general area with the goal to collect qualitative data for rare, larger, and cryptic organisms, such as Crown of Thorns Starfish and Triton's Trumpet snails which may not be seen during belt-transect surveys, and to survey any additional habitats present at the site, e.g. sand, sea grass, pavement, etc. This was accomplished by swimming a zig-zag pattern that extends roughly 5 m on either side of the two transect lines (total length = 500 m). Quadrat surveys were used to quantify the smaller, more cryptic invertebrates which were sometimes overlooked or too numerous to count during belt-transect surveys. Ten 0.25-m2 quadrats were laid out at 2-m intervals along two of the 25-m transects (total area = 5 m2). For each quadrat the percent cover of sponges, octocorals and zoanthids was recorded, as well as urchins, hermit crabs of the genus Calcinus, trapezid crabs, and coralliophilid snails. In addition, up to 25 cm diameters of all urchin species are measured. Based on data from previous REA surveys, a group of target invertebrate species was chosen for quantitative counts at 2 REA sites at Pathfinder Bank in the Marianas Archipelago. The species in the list were chosen because they have been shown to be common components of the reef habitats and they are species that are generally visible (i.e.; non-cryptic) and easily enumerated during the course of a single 50-60 minute SCUBA survey.Proposed removal of dams will change the characteristics of stream flow and will affect fish that swim upstream to spawn. A mathematical model of the river flow tells us where the likely problems will be located and how the flow will change.The Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) from The National Map (TNM) defines the perimeter of drainage areas formed by the terrain and other landscape characteristics. The drainage areas are nested within each other so that a large drainage area, such as the Upper Mississippi River, will be composed of multiple smaller drainage areas, such as the Wisconsin River. Each of these smaller areas can further be subdivided into smaller and smaller drainage areas. The WBD uses six different levels in this hierarchy, with the smallest averaging about 30,000 acres. The WBD is made up of polygons nested into six levels of data respectively defined by Regions, Subregions, Basins, Subbasins, Watersheds, and Subwatersheds. For additional information on the WBD, go to http://nhd.usgs.gov/wbd.html. The USGS National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) service is a companion dataset to the WBD. The NHD is a comprehensive set of digital spatial data that encodes information about naturally occurring and constructed bodies of surface water (lakes, ponds, and reservoirs), paths through which water flows (canals, ditches, streams, and rivers), and related entities such as point features (springs, wells, stream gages, and dams). The information encoded about these features includes classification and other characteristics, delineation, geographic name, position and related measures, a "reach code" through which other information can be related to the NHD, and the direction of water flow. The network of reach codes delineating water and transported material flow allows users to trace movement in upstream and downstream directions. In addition to this geographic information, the dataset contains metadata that supports the exchange of future updates and improvements to the data. The NHD is available nationwide in two seamless datasets, one based on 1:24,000-scale maps and referred to as high resolution NHD, and the other based on 1:100,000-scale maps and referred to as medium resolution NHD. Additional selected areas in the United States are available based on larger scales, such as 1:5,000-scale or greater, and referred to as local resolution NHD. For more information on the NHD, go to http://nhd.usgs.gov/index.html. Hydrography data from The National Map supports many applications, such as making maps, geocoding observations, flow modeling, data maintenance, and stewardship. Hydrography data is commonly combined with other data themes, such as boundaries, elevation, structures, and transportation, to produce general reference base maps.

Towboard surveys are a good method for obtaining a general description of large reef areas, assessing the status of low-density populations of large-bodied reef fish, large-scale disturbances (e.g., bleaching), general distribution and abundance patterns of macro-invertebrates (e.g., COT, giant clams), and for assessing trends in these populations and metrics. A pair of scuba divers (1 fish and 1 benthic diver) are towed 60 m behind a small survey launch at a speed of 1-2 knots and a depth of approximately 15m. Each survey is 50 min long, covers about 2 km of habitat, and is divided into ten 5-minute survey segments. The fish diver records, to the lowest possible taxon, all large-bodied reef fishes (>50cmTL) seen within 5m either side and 10m in front of the towboard. Length of each individual is estimated to the nearest cm. The fish towboard is also outfitted with a forward-facing digital video camera to record the survey swath. The benthic diver records percent cover of coral and macroalgae, estimates benthic habitat type and complexity, and censuses a suite of benthic macroinvertebrates including Crown of Thorns sea stars and sea urchins. The benthic towboard is equipped with a downward-facing digital still camera which images the benthos at 15 second intervals. These images are analyzed for percent cover of coral, algae, and other benthic components. Both towboards are equipped with SEABIRD SBE-39 temperature/depth sensors set to record at 5 second intervals. Latitude and longitude of each survey track is recorded at 15 second intervals using a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver onboard the tow boat. A layback algorithm is applied to more accurately map the position of the divers with respect to the reef environment. This algorithm calculates the position of the divers based on the position of the tow boat taking into account the length of the tow rope, the depth of the divers, and the curvature of the survey track. This metadata applies to the benthic characterization observations.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

This work is extending lessons learned from the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska, through the Cosco Busan spill in San Francisco Bay, to an array of current and intensive activities associated with the Deepwater Horizon natural resource damage assessment in the Gulf of Mexico. This research has been particularly influential in recent years (PNAS papers in 2011 and 2012), with major Deepwater papers forthcoming in 2012 and 2013. Funding has come from NOS/ORR, the Oiled Wildlife Care Network, the Prince William Sound Regional Citizen's Advisory Council, the San Francisco Estuary Institute, and other sources.

NDBC has installed approximately 50 C-MAN stations on lighthouses, at capes and beaches, on near shore islands, and on offshore platforms. NDBC has deployed over 100 moored (a.k.a., weather) buoys in coastal and offshore waters from the western Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean around Hawaii, and from the Bering Sea to the South Pacific. C-MAN and moored buoy data typically include barometric pressure, wind direction, speed and gust, and air temperature; however, some C-MAN stations are equipped to also measure seawater temperature, water level, waves, and relative humidity. Moored buoys measure wave energy spectra from which NDBC derives significant wave height, dominant wave period, and average wave period. In addition, many moored buoys measure the direction of wave propagation. In collaboration, NDBC and the National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) are archiving these data from C-MAN and moored buoys.

The gravimetric geoid models are referred to the Geodetic Reference System of 1980 (GRS80), situated in the most recent IGS reference frame . The hybrid geoid models and associated deflection of the vertical models refer to the NAD 83 datum, and are used as a transformation between NAD 83 and NAVD 88. Major geoid products were released in 1990, 1993, 1996, 1999, 2003, 2006, 2009, and 2012. Each release represents an improvement in accuracy over the previous models but, more specifically, represents an improved tie to the spatial reference information existing on bench marks archived in the NGS database at the time they were generated. Hence, NAD 83 and NAVD 88 coordinate information collected and processed in 2003 are consistent with the GEOID03 model. Whereas recently collected data are more consistent with GEOID12A. The newest (2012) products are (1) USGG2012, a gravimetric geoid model, (2) GEOID12A, a hybrid geoid model. A GEOID12 model existed briefly but was replaced with GEOID12A when defects were found in control data used to determine GEOID12. These were fixed and a GEOID12A model released. USGG2012 converts between IGS08 (2005.0) and a geopotential surface built upon the underlying EGM2008 (separate product developed by NGA) reference geoid height model for all regions (conterminous US (CONUS), Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico/Virgin Islands, Guam & the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), and American Samoa). GEOID12A converts between NAD 83 (2011.0) and NAVD 88 for CONUS and Alaska only, between NAD 83 (PA11) and the local vertical datums in Hawaii, and American Samoa, and NAD 83 (MA11) and the local vertical datums in Guam and CNMI. Within CONUS, most users should use GEOID12A. It is constructed specifically to relate GPS ellipsoid heights in the NAD 83 datum (epoch 2011.0) and orthometric heights in the NAVD 88 datum including those in the Gulf Coast Subsidence Regions where Vertical Time Dependent Positioning is employed to determine NAVD 88 heights. These are the datums used in many maps and charts, and most applications require that consistency. GEOID12A also exists for Alaska to provide a transformation between NAD 83 and NAVD 88 - where it is available. NAVD 88 coverage in Alaska is not complete and may not be suitable for all regions. For some scientific applications, use of USGG2012 is appropriate (for water flow and height transfer). However, NAVD 88 remains the official vertical datum approved for use in charting and surveying. No NAVD 88 coverage exists in Hawaii, so GEOID12A converts between the same geopotential surface determined for USGG2012 and NAD 83 (PA11).Guam, CNMI, American Samoa, Puerto Rico (PR), and the U.S. Virgin Islands (VI) all have their own separate vertical datums distinct from NAVD 88. GEOID12A converts between the appropriate local version of NAD 83 and the respective vertical datums for each of these regions. The GEOID12A product comprises eight files for the conterminous US, four files for Alaska, and one each for Hawaii, PR/VI, American Samoa, and Guam/CNMI. Single grids also are available for CONUS and Alaska. Each file contains geoid heights on a one minute by one minute grid in both big-endian and little-endian binary (PC compatible) formats. The INTG program is supplied at the download site to interpolate to a specific position within these grids. Another program, XNTG, is supplied to extract subsets and convert the grids between ASCII and binary. Both are in FORTRAN, are available compiled and as source code, and can byte-swap the grids if needed on a Unix platform. There is also an on-line geoid computational facility within the NGS Geodetic Tool Kit at http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/TOOLS. Similar files, programs, and on-line computational facilities exist for USGG2012, USDOV2012 and DEFLEC12A99. USDOV2012 and DEFLEC12A are Deflection of the Vertical models that describe the angular difference between the normal (plumblines) to the ellipsoid and vertical datum. USDOV2012 was determined from USGG2012, while DEFLEC12A was determined from GEOID12A. Hence, USDOV2012 is in IGS08 (2005.0 ), and DEFLEC12A is in NAD 83 (2011/PA11/MA11). See the GEOID section of the NGS Web site at http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/GEOID. Geoid and deflection of the vertical models for Mexico and the Caribbean were computed in 1997 and are distributed as MEXICO97, DMEX97, CARIB97, and DCAR97 respectively. Note, however, these models are largely superseded by the GGM10 model developed by INEGI in Mexico. All geoid products covered here are considered valid inside the U.S. and its territories only. Geoid height values, especially for GEOID12A, are valid within national boundaries. Canada and Mexico are sovereign nations with their own national height systems. For other areas outside of the above models or other national interests, the EGM2008 model exists as a highly accurate global reference model. NGS also offers technical information concerning the construction of the geoid models and practical information concerning its use on the NGS web site at http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/GEOID. NGS also offers a workshop concerning GPS derived heights and the use of the geoid models to convert from GPS derived heights to orthometric heights (see http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/PC_PROD/WorkShops/).National Water Information System (NWIS) real-time data on selected ground water sites, ground water level data, site inventory of wells, test holes, drains, springs and excavations and ground water-quality data for the United States.Rare Bear Sightings by ParishSpecial handling must be used because these one-celled organisms break down easily if dried, and the scientific analysis is enhanced by identifying smaller specimens.

Rate calculations were computed within a GIS using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) version 4.1, an ArcGIS extension developed by the U.S. Geological Survey. Short-term rates of shoreline change for the lower 48 states were calculated using an end-point rate method based on shorelines from 1970 or 1978 and 2000 to provide an approximately 30-yr short-term rate. Short-term rates of shoreline change for Hawaii were calculated using a weighted linear regression rate based on all available shoreline data between 1950 and 2008. A reference baseline was used as the originating point for the orthogonal transects cast by the DSAS software. The transects intersect each shoreline establishing measurement points, which are then used to calculate short-term rates.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

The ARLSS database contains over 5000 sites, and is regularly updated. The database is publicly available in variety of formats to address the needs of different user communities. The data can be browsed via 2D and 3D interfaces online or accessed in Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) formats including a Web Map Service (WMS), Web Feature Service (WFS) and Keyhole Markup Language (KML). For details visit: http://armap.org/armap_services.aspxA seamless (bare-earth and submerged) elevation map (also known as a Digital Elevation Model, or DEM) of a portion of western Florida, post-Hurricane Charley, was produced from remotely sensed, geographically referenced elevation measurements cooperatively by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Elevation measurements were collected over the area using the NASA Experimental Advanced Airborne Research Lidar (EAARL), a pulsed laser ranging system mounted onboard an aircraft to measure ground elevation, vegetation canopy, and coastal topography. The system uses high-frequency laser beams directed at the Earth's surface through an opening in the bottom of the aircraft's fuselage. The laser system records the time difference between emission of the laser beam and the reception of the reflected laser signal in the aircraft. The plane travels over the target area at approximately 50 meters per second at an elevation of approximately 300 meters. The EAARL, developed by NASA at Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia, measures ground elevation with a vertical resolution of +/-15 centimeters. A sampling rate of 3 kilohertz or higher results in an extremely dense spatial elevation dataset. Over 100 kilometers of coastline can be surveyed easily within a 3- to 4-hour mission. When subsequent elevation maps for an area are analyzed, they provide a useful tool to make management decisions regarding land development.

The on-line NMHRR linkage is http://hazmat.fmcsa.dot.gov/nhmrr/index.asp With the exception of 13 features that were not identified with the Tiger/Lines, Hazmat routes were created by extracting the TIGER/Line segments that corresponded to each individual route. Hazmat routes in the NTAD, are organized into 3 database files, hazmat.shp, hmroutes.dbf, and hmstcnty.dbf. Each record in each database represents a unique Tiger/Line segment. These Tiger/Line segments are grouped into routes identified as character strings in the ROUTE_ID field in the hmroutes.dbf table. The route name appearing in the ROUTE_ID is assigned by FMCSA and is unique for each State [this sentence could be deleted - it doesn't add a lot to it]. The hmstcnty.dbf table allows the user to select routes by State and County.

The files consist of line segments representing physical features and governmental and statistical boundaries. They do NOT contain the ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) and the address ranges are of approximately the same vintage as those appearing in the 1999 TIGER/Line files. That is, the Census Bureau is producing these files in advance of the computer processing that will ensure that the address ranges in the TIGER/Line files agree with the final Master Address File (MAF) used for tabulating Census 2000. The files contain information distributed over a series of record types for the spatial objects of a county. There are 17 record types, including the basic data record, the shape coordinate points, and geographic codes that can be used with appropriate software to prepare maps. Other geographic information contained in the files includes attributes such as feature identifiers/census feature class codes (CFCC) used to differentiate feature types, address ranges and ZIP Codes codes for legal and statistical entities, latitude/longitude coordinates of linear and point features, landmark point features, area landmarks, key geographic features, and area boundaries.Even a casual, untrained observer will see evidence that opposing forces have formed the Hawaiian Islands. The massive and lofty volcanoes have been scoured, abraded, and lacerated by streams and the sea. On the oldestislands (in the northwest) the volcanic mountains have been eroded and deeply cut by canyons. Even farther north are coral reefs and atolls--all that remain of former islands. This slide set examines volcanic features and their erosion by waves, glaciers, streams, and storms. The images include dramatic examples of Hawaii's unique geology. The Erosional and Depositional Geology of the Hawaiian Islands. Even a casual, untrained observer will see evidence that opposing forces have formed the Hawaiian Islands. The massive and lofty volcanoes have been scoured, abraded, and lacerated by streams and the sea. The early Hawaiians themselves recognized this conflict between the volcanoes that built the islands and the forces that eroded them. The people created stories about two goddess sisters: Pele and Na Maka O Kaha'i. Pele, the goddess of fire was depicted as always building a new home for herself ( volcano). Na Kaka O Kaha'i, the evil goddess of the sea, continually hunted out Pele and attempted to destroy her home. This is an apt description of the geology of the islands. On the oldest islands (in the northwest), the volcanic mountains have been eroded and deeply cut by canyons. Even further north are coral reefs and atolls all that remain of former islands. The older islands show evidence of a resurgence of volcanism. The myths attribute this to Pele's attempt to fight back against the force of water that sought to destroy her homes. Scientists believe that continents and ocean basins drift, or move slowly, relative to eachother and to Earth's hot interior. The Pacific Ocean floor is drifting to the northwest over a hot spot the source of the molten material which is building the volcanic islands. While olderislands erode, new islands form to the southeast as new sections of the ocean floor move over thehot spot. On these islands, the geological features are on a grand scale. On the Big IslandHawaii), Mauna Loa and Mauna Kea rise from the ocean depths of 5,486 m (18,000 ft) to a maximum elevation above sea level of nearly 4,267 m (14,000 ft). They are among the tallest mountain masses on Earth. The islands are characterized by cliffs, or palis, some of which may have originated as the subaerial scars above giant submarine landslides. These cliffs are striking and steep, and deeply grooved as though Na MaKa O Kaha'i herself had attempted to draw more land into the sea with her long fingernails. As a new Hawaiian volcano was born on the ocean floor, pillow lava and a rubble of fragmented lava formed the submarine portion of the future island. When the volcano finally emerged above the sea, the submarine rubble and debris were covered by solid layers of lava flows. The weight of these layers pressed on the underlying weak debris. As the huge shield volcano settled under its own weight, cracks opened that permitted magma to intrude laterally and reach the surface on the flanks of the shield. Some of the cracks became planes of weakness in the underlying rubble, allowing the volcanic slopes to slide massively down and out onto the deep floor. On the emergent part of the volcano, lava flows continued to build the island, while the forces of erosion, waves, wind, rain, freshwater streams, landslides, and even glaciers carved the land and delivered sediment to the sea. Some of the larger valleys and canyons have eroded where streams took advantage of weak zones in faulted bedrock. Hawaii's beaches have many colors of sand. White sand, the most abundant, is of marine origin, derived from skeletal fragments of shallow-water marine organisms. Dark-gray detrital sand is eroded basalt, deposited mainly by streams, but also by waves. Tan sand is a mixture of the white and gray. Green sand is created as waves attack olivine-bearing cinder and tuff. Black sand commonly forms when hot lava enters the cooler ocean, fragments, and is deposited on the beach. All these features combine to give the islands of Hawaii a unique and incomparable beauty.IACETDoxygen SearchNortek 600kHz Aquadopp acoustic current profilers were deployed between March 2010 and April 2011 on shallow water moorings located in Vieques Sound, Puerto Rico, and Virgin Passage USVI.

Towboard surveys are a good method for obtaining a general description of large reef areas, assessing the status of low-density populations of large-bodied reef fish, large-scale disturbances (e.g., bleaching), general distribution and abundance patterns of macro-invertebrates (e.g., COT, giant clams), and for assessing trends in these populations and metrics. A pair of scuba divers (1 fish and 1 benthic diver) are towed 60 m behind a small survey launch at a speed of 1-2 knots and a depth of approximately 15m. Each survey is 50 min long, covers about 2 km of habitat, and is divided into ten 5-minute survey segments. The fish diver records, to the lowest possible taxon, all large-bodied reef fishes (>50cmTL) seen within 5m either side and 10m in front of the towboard. Length of each individual is estimated to the nearest cm. The fish towboard is also outfitted with a forward-facing digital video camera to record the survey swath. The benthic diver records percent cover of coral and macroalgae, estimates benthic habitat type and complexity, and censuses a suite of benthic macroinvertebrates including Crown of Thorns sea stars and sea urchins. The benthic towboard is equipped with a downward-facing digital still camera which images the benthos at 15 second intervals. These images are analyzed for percent cover of coral, algae, and other benthic components. Both towboards are equipped with SEABIRD SBE-39 temperature/depth sensors set to record at 5 second intervals. Latitude and longitude of each survey track is recorded at 15 second intervals using a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver onboard the tow boat. A layback algorithm is applied to more accurately map the position of the divers with respect to the reef environment. This algorithm calculates the position of the divers based on the position of the tow boat taking into account the length of the tow rope, the depth of the divers, and the curvature of the survey track. This metadata applies to the benthic characterization observations.Consistent, real-time water data from streams, lakes, reservoirs, ground-water, and meteorological sites, are available from the USGS National Water Information System as graphs, tables, or files to download.powered by the HUBzero(R) Platform for Scientific CollaborationTwo sheets of 3D images showing geologic features of many National Parks.

These activities were implemented in response to requirements outlined in the Mapping Implementation Plan developed by the Mapping and Information Synthesis Working Group (MISWG) of the Coral Reef Task Force (CRTF). As part of the MISWG of the CRTF, NOS's Biogeography Team has been charged with the development and implementation of a plan to produce comprehensive digital coral-reef ecosystem maps for all U.S. States, Territories, and Commonwealths within five to seven years. Joint activities between Federal agencies are particularly important to map, research, monitor, manage, and restore coral reef ecosystems. In response to the Executive Order 13089, NOS is conducting research to digitally map biotic resources and coordinate a long-term monitoring program that can detect and predict change in U.S. coral reefs, and their associated habitats and biological communities. Most U.S. coral reef resources have not been digitally mapped at a scale or resolution sufficient for assessment, monitoring, and/or research to support resource management. Thus, a large portion of NOS' coral reef research activities have focused on mapping of U.S. coral reef ecosystems. The map products will provide the fundamental spatial organizing framework to implement and integrate research programs and provide the capability to effectively communicate information and results to coral reef ecosystem managers. Although the NOS coral program is relatively young, it has had tremendous success in advancing towards the goal to protect, conserve, and enhance the health of U.S. coral reef ecosystems. One objective of the program was to create benthic habitat maps to support coral reef research to enable development of products that support management needs and questions. Therefore this product was developed in collaboration with many Hawaiian partners, including Hawaii's Department of Land and Natural Resources, a leading coral reef management agency. An initial step in producing benthic habitat maps is the development of a habitat classification scheme. This dataset focuses on the in situ data used to ground truth the mapping efforts on the main Hawaiian Islands: Hawaii, Maui, Molokai, Lanai, Oahu, Kauai, and Niihau.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

Data set contains 35 individual core data sets plus time series 1746-1982 of average calcification rate for 10 of these sites. The Australian Institute of Marine Science began collecting cores from very large massive colonies of Porites on the Great Barrier Reef in the early 1980s. Such cores cannot normally be identified to species. The cores were mounted and sawn to remove slices that were about 6-7mm thick. All slices were X-rayed and skeletal density measured along a central track on each slice using a gamma densitometer. The high density portion of annual density bands in Porites from the Great Barrier Reef appears to form usually between October and March, the Southern Hemisphere summer. Peaks in the density profiles were successively counted backwards from the last (outermost or youngest) peak. Density was assumed to peak in January and the most recent peak was dated from the date of collection of the core. Dates were then assigned to all peaks in the series. Time series of the following skeletal growth parameters were then obtained: 1) Average annual density (g.cm-3) 2) Annual linear extension measured between high density peaks (cm.yr-1) 3) Annual calcification (g.cm-2.yr-1_; the product of annual average density and annual linear extension. These data were obtained from coral cores taken at 35 sites on the Great Barrier Reef. The density profiles do not always display regular, obvious annual peaks and we could not be absolutely sure of the dating for some profiles. We consider there may be errors of + or - 2-3 years in the starting data of some of these series. File AIMS10CoreAvg.txt: Time series of average calcification rate is based on 10 Porites corals for 1746-1982: Jeannie River, Flinders Reef, Brook Island, Britomart Reef, Lodestone Reef, Wheeler Reef, Havannah Island, Hook Island, Sanctuary Reef, and Abraham Reef. 3 series are presented: 1) Annual average values expressed as standardized anomalies; each of the 10 series was converted to standardized anomalies with respect to 1934-1982 mean and sd; resulting series then averaged for 10 corals. 2) Annual average standardized anomales filtered with 5-year gaussian filter. 3) Annual average series converted to original calcification units (g.cm-2.yr-1) filtered with 5-year gaussian filter. Because of potential dating errors the last two series are considered to be most reliable. Lough and Barnes (1997) suggest that ~30% of the variance in the 10-coral calcification series can be explained by variations of annual sea-surface temperature.NAMICWeb (en)Pydap 3.2 documentation Search Pydap 3.2 documentationBorehole temperature measurements in West VirginiaA compendium of previously published databases and database records that describe PGE, nickel, and chromium deposits and occurrences.USGS Publications Warehouse Search The Pubs Warehouse provides access to over 130,000 publications written by USGS scientists over the century-plus history of the bureauUSGS water resources home page for Nevada with links to detailed hydrologic studies and long-term and real-time data on streamflow, ground and surface water, droughts, and water quality plus district and publications information.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

Map 167 is available on the NBMG website Publication Sales page or the direct publication page, and is an updated depiction of data from the U.S. Geological Survey s Quaternary Fault and Fold Database for the United States (available at: http://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/qfaults). Updates came primarily from geological maps published by the Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology and numerous geotechnical consulting reports. Mapped faults are shown as solid lines on Map 167, whereas faults that are inferred are shown as dashed lines. However, many Quaternary faults remain undetected and unmapped, especially in alluvial valleys where they are covered by young sediments, in the mountains where a lack of young sediments makes determination of a Quaternary age difficult, deep in the Earth where detection relies on seismology and other remote sensing techniques, and in areas that have not yet been studied.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities. Hydrographic survey data primarily consist of water depths, but may also include features (e.g. rocks, wrecks), navigation aids, shoreline identification, and bottom type information. NOAA is responsible for archiving and distributing the source data as described in this metadata record.Geochemical analyses of rocks, mineral separates, lake and stream sediment bulk samples, heavy-mineral concentrates, and soils collected by USGS in Alaska from 1962 through 2009.Essential fish habitat (EFH) for Gulf of Mexico Red Drum consists of the following waters and substrate areas in the Gulf of Mexico: all estuaries; Vermilion Bay, Louisiana, to the eastern edge of Mobile Bay, Alabama, out to depths of 25 fathoms; Crystal River, Florida, to Naples, Florida, between depths of 5 and 10 fathoms; and Cape Sable, Florida, to the boundary between the areas covered by the GMFMC and the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (SAFMC) between depths of 5 and 10 fathoms. Essential fish habitat (EFH) consists of areas of higher species density, based on the NOAA Atlas (NOAA 1985) and the functional relationships analysis in the EIS (GMFMC 2004).Tunnels in the United States According to the HSIP Tiger Team Report, a tunnel is defined as a linear underground passageway open at both ends. This dataset is based on the U.S. Department of Transportation's National Bridge Inventory (NBI). Records in the NBI that are attributed as "Tunnels" were extracted by TGS and were located using a combination of ortho imagery, topographic DRGs, NAVTEQ streets, and NAVTEQ railroads. Two points were captured for each tunnel, one at each tunnel opening. A line was then created either by tracing the NAVTEQ street / railroad, or, if there was not a NAVTEQ street / railroad coincident with the tunnel, then by a straight line joining the two points. For some tunnels, the NBI contains two records, one for the road through the tunnel and one for the road on top of the tunnel (if any). In these cases, both have been captured in this dataset. Features in this dataset that are over tunnels have a [RECTYPE] of "1", while features that are in tunnels have a [RECTYPE] of "2". Presumably, this was done because both roads could be blocked if the tunnel was destroyed. In some cases, the NBI only represented a tunnel with a record of type = "1" (over). In these cases, the following rules were applied: 1) If there was no road running through the tunnel, the road on top of the tunnel was captured. For example, if a mine conveyor runs through the tunnel and a county highway runs on top of the tunnel, the county highway was captured. 2) If a road ran through the tunnel, then this road was captured and the [RECTYPE] was changed to "2". The "feature carried" and "feature intersected" fields were also changed to be consistent with the feature actually captured. According to the U.S. DOT: "Our reporting requirements do not extend to tunnels, therefore, any info we have should be considered incomplete."The rainfall-runoff erosivity factor (R-Factor) quantifies the effects of raindrop impacts and reflects the amount and rate of runoff associated with the rain. The R-factor is one of the parameters used by the Revised Unified Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) to estimate annual rates of erosion. This product is a raster representation of R-Factor derived from isoerodent maps published in the Agriculture Handbook Number 703 (Renard et al.,1997). Lines connecting points of equal rainfall ersoivity are called isoerodents. The iserodents plotted on a map of the Island of Kauai were digitized, then values between these lines were obtained by linear interpolation. The final R-Factor data are in raster GeoTiff format at 30 meter resolution in UTM, Zone 4, GRS80, NAD83.These data represent the geographic area described in Title 50 CFR Part 622.35(b)(1), Fisheries of the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico, and South Atlantic, Subpart B - Reef Fish Resources of the Gulf of Mexico, Gear restricted areas, Seasonal prohibitions applicable to bottom longline fishing for Gulf reef fish, as of 07/01/13.The International Hydrographic Organization is an intergovernmental consultative and technical organization that was established in 1921 to support safety of navigation and the protection of the marine environment.Publication (PDF format) in three parts on the biostratigraphy and lithostratigraphy of the Ibexian Series in the North American Ordovician, with sections on the southern Egan Range, Nevada and the biostratigraphy of the eastern Great Basin.powered by the HUBzero(R) Platform for Scientific CollaborationAnnotated bibliography describing the use of electromagnetic surveying to understand the characteristics of aquifers and how they work.Guidelines for correct tsunami response and community preparedness from local emergency managers, first-responders, and leading experts on tsunami hazards and warnings.Geological research of the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary sea floor are presented in the form of maps, posters, fact sheets, sonar images, and bottom photographs.U.S. Geological Survey, Department of the Interior - The annual Geographic Names acquisition plan is to collect geographic name data over the United States and its territories through the Board on Geographic Names processes. The U.S. Board on Geographic Names is a Federal body created in 1890 and established in its present form by Public Law in 1947 to maintain uniform geographic name usage throughout the Federal Government. The Board comprises representatives of Federal agencies concerned with geographic information, population, ecology, and management of public lands. Sharing its responsibilities with the Secretary of the Interior, the Board promulgates official geographic feature names with locative attributes as well as principles, policies, and procedures governing the use of domestic names, foreign names, Antarctic names, and undersea feature names. The Geographic Names Information System (GNIS), developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in cooperation with the U.S. Board on Geographic Names (BGN), contains information about the official names for places, features, and areas in the 50 States, the District of Columbia, the territories and outlying areas of the United States, including Antarctica.The Board of Geographic Names maintains working relationships with State names authorities to cooperate in achieving the standardization of geographic names. GNIS is the geographic names component of The National Map.

Faster growth and larger body size are generally associated with higher marine survival for most species of juvenile salmon, which experience relatively high mortality rates during early marine life. The interaction between the temporal-spatial distribution of juvenile salmon, growth performance, environmental conditions, and stage-specific survival are critical to understanding how physical and biological factors contribute to production and survival, and influence the mechanisms, magnitude, location, and timing of marine mortality. The northern Coastal Gulf of Alaska (CGOA) is a highly productive, down-welling based system where freshwater runoff and winds dominate the physical processes on the shelf. The physical environment changes at different spatial and temporal scales, which is believed to influence inter-annual variability in distribution, feeding, growth, and survival of juvenile salmon. Pink salmon are the upper trophic level target species of GLOBEC, however, the overarching programmatic goal is to enhance our understanding of the processes driving the physical structure and biological productivity of the highly dynamic CGOA system.The Gridded Satellite Data from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) B1 (or GridSat-B1) provides a uniform set of quality-controlled satellite observations for the visible, infrared window and infrared water vapor channels during the time period of record of the ISCCP B1 dataset. This global Fundamental Climate Data Record (FCDR) provides equal-angle gridded uniform observations of brightness temperatures every 3 hours from 1980 to the present. The ISCCP B1 data have been quality controlled, calibrated, remapped and merged together to provide a nearly global coverage of top of the atmosphere radiances. Long-term temporal normalization is performed via calibration against HIRS channel 12 data during the GridSat period of record. The GridSat IR window channel data has received more extensive inter-satellite calibration than the other channels and is the only variable noted as a CDR by the NOAA CDR Program (other variables such as visible and infrared water vapor data are not yet at NOAA CDR quality). GridSat data are provided in an equal angle map projection, which facilitates the mapping and subsetting of the data. Since the ISCCP B1 native resolution is approximately 8km, the resolution of the equal area grid is 0.07 degrees latitude (approximately 8km at the Equator). The data span the globe in longitude and range from 70 degrees South to 70 degrees North. Areas of satellite overlap are retained by storing data in layers. Data are stored using netCDF-4 file format following the Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions and Attribute Convention for Dataset Discovery (ACDD) which facilitate usage with compatible software applications. Channel primary layers (nadir-most observation) are written as 2-dimensional grids in the netCDF file, which facilitates processing of multiple files (e.g., aggregation of multiple times, etc.). Subsequent layers are written as either 2D grids or staggered arrays (1-dimensional arrays that only record data when they exist), whichever is more efficient. The IR data have been applied to tropical cyclones, the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), global and regional precipitation monitoring, diurnal variation and outgoing longwave radiation. CDR documentation and source code for the product is included in the data submission. In short, GridSat version 2 differs from version 1 in the following ways: a) 3 channels are now provided instead of just one, b) more quality control on the calibration, navigation and flagging of bad data and c) extension of the period of record.GIS data files containing approximate boundaries of the various USGS quadrangles, with names and indexing codes associated with each quadrangle.Free Software Directory (en)The University of Maryland Council on the Environment serves as an advisory group to the University of Maryland on research, education, outreach, and economic development as they relate to the environment, both globally and regionally.powered by the HUBzero(R) Platform for Scientific CollaborationGEOTRACES, An International Study of Marine Biogeochemical Cycles of Trace Elements and their IsotopesExplains the natural and human-affected factors that determine the concentration of contaminants in groundwater, especially where the concentration is different at the surface than at depth, and where pumping varies with time.Dataset shows measurements made by selected ship sensors on the NOAA ship Okeanos Explorer during expeditions from 2008 to the present time.

Fishermen sample Chinook salmon at sea. Genetic Stock Identification (GSI) analysis is used to determine stock of origin. Scales are examined to determine age, and other biological and physical data are taken. The purpose is to develop Fishery information system with multiple goals. The target audience is the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) and Pacific Salmon Commission (PSC) Management, as well as fishermen, scientists, marketers, educators, and the general public. This is a stand-alone project, with one principal point of contact in NMFS. This project is ongoing. Chinook genetics for stock identificationA first-surface elevation map (also known as a Digital Elevation Model, or DEM) of a portion of western Florida, post-Hurricane Charley, was produced from remotely sensed, geographically referenced elevation measurements cooperatively by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Elevation measurements were collected over the area using the NASA Experimental Advanced Airborne Research Lidar (EAARL), a pulsed laser ranging system mounted onboard an aircraft to measure ground elevation, vegetation canopy, and coastal topography. The system uses high-frequency laser beams directed at the Earth's surface through an opening in the bottom of the aircraft's fuselage. The laser system records the time difference between emission of the laser beam and the reception of the reflected laser signal in the aircraft. The plane travels over the target area at approximately 50 meters per second at an elevation of approximately 300 meters. The EAARL, developed by NASA at Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia, measures ground elevation with a vertical resolution of +/-15 centimeters. A sampling rate of 3 kilohertz or higher results in an extremely dense spatial elevation dataset. Over 100 kilometers of coastline can be surveyed easily within a 3- to 4-hour mission. When subsequent elevation maps for an area are analyzed, they provide a useful tool to make management decisions regarding land development.

This is a suite of yearly data sets (Plants beginning in 2009, Animals beginning in 2010) each provided with and without full phenophase definitions.This data set contains imagery from the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP). The NAIP acquires digital ortho imagery during the agricultural growing seasons in the continental U.S.. A primary goal of the NAIP program is to enable availability of ortho imagery within one year of acquisition. The NAIP provides two main products: 1 meter ground sample distance (GSD) ortho imagery rectified to a horizontal accuracy within +/- 5 meters of reference digital ortho quarter quads (DOQQ's) from the National Digital Ortho Program (NDOP) or from the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP); 1 meter GSD ortho imagery rectified within +/- 6 meters to true ground. The tiling format of NAIP imagery is based on a 3.75' x 3.75' quarter quadrangle with a 300 meter buffer on all four sides. The NAIP imagery is formatted to the UTM coordinate system using the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). The NAIP imagery may contain as much as 10% cloud cover per tile. The quarter quads have been reprojected from UTM 11 or UTM 12 to IDTM83 projection (ESPG 102605), mosaicked into 100k tiles, and compressed using ERDAS Imagine for use in ArcGIS.The data included in the GIS Traffic Stations Version database have been collected by the FHWA from the State DOTs (NTAD 2014). Location referencing information was derived from State offices of Transportation The attributes on the point elements of the database are used by FHWA for its Travel Monitoring and Analysis System and by State DOTs. The attributes for these databases have been intentionally limited to location referencing attributes since the core station description attribute data are contained within the Station Description Tables (SDT). here is a separate Station Description Table (SDT) for each of the station types. The attributes in the Station Description Table correspond with the Station Description Record found in Chapter 6 of the latest Traffic Monitoring Guide. The SDT contains the most recent stations available for each state and station type. This table was derived from files provided UTCTR by FHWA. The Station Description Table can be linked to the station shapefile via the STNNKEY field. Some station where not located in the US, and were beyond available geographic extents causing display problems. These were moved to Lat and Long 0,0. This is in recognition that the locations of these stations where in error, but were moved to a less obtusive area.Search interface allowing searches of earthquake databases by various parameters including date, depth, intensity, area, and magnitude and download data in a variety of formats.WMSITIS is an easily accessible database with reliable information on species names and their hierarchical classification that is publicly accessible with unlimited free use.

The vector data file is included in "Habitat_PointReyes.zip," which is accessible from http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/781/OffshorePointReyes/data_catalog_OffshorePointReyes.html. Using multibeam echosounder (MBES) bathymetry and backscatter data, potential marine benthic habitat maps were constructed. The habitats were based on substrate types and documented or "ground truthed" using underwater video images and seafloor samples obtained by the USGS. These maps display various habitat types that range from flat, soft, unconsolidated sediment-covered seafloor to hard, deformed (folded), or highly rugose and differentially eroded bedrock exposures. Rugged, high-relief, rocky outcrops that have been eroded to form ledges and small caves are ideal habitat for rockfish (Sebastes spp.) and other bottom fish such as lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus). Habitat map is presented in a map format generated in a GIS (ArcMap), and both digital and hard-copy versions will be produced.This project is a cooperative effort among the National Ocean Service, National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science, Center for Coastal Monitoring and Assessment; the University of Hawaii; and Analytical Laboratories of Hawaii, LLC. IKONOS imagery was purchased to support the Pacific Islands Geographic Information System (GIS) project and the National Ocean Service's (NOS) coral mapping activities. One-meter panchromatic and four-meter multi-spectral data were purchased for each study area. The enhanced spectral resolution of multispectral imagery and control of bandwidths of multispectral data yield an advantage over color aerial photography particularly when coral health and time series analysis of coral reef community structure are of interest. The IKONOS imagery was processed to minimize atmospheric and water column effects. Photointerpreters can accurately and reliably delineate boundaries of features in the imagery as they appear on the computer monitor using a software interface such as the Habitat Digitizer.Location and characteristics of 123 sediment-hosted gold deposits worldwide.People who manage recreational areas need better, more timely estimates of the likelihood that the beach and lake waters will be hazardous to human health, and which factors cause those hazards.Geographic and scientific information focused on health issues in the area of the US-Mexico borderThe Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) is a spreadsheet maintained by the VT Agency of Transportation (VTrans).

The HPMS spreadsheet was provided to VCGI on 10/11/93. HPMS consists of 'universe elements' (all records) and 'sample elements' for a subset of sample records. In the VTrans spreadsheets, the sample sections include more detailed information than for the universe elements. Only the information available for all universe elements is included with TransStats_HPMS93.This web map service (WMS) depicts estimates of mean values within selected habitats and parent material characteristics across GB were made using CS data using a mixed model approach. The estimated means of habitat/parent material combinations using 2007 data are modelled on dominant habitat and parent material characteristics derived from the Land Cover Map 2007 and Parent Material Model 2009, respectively. Areas, such as urban and littoral rock, are not sampled by CS and therefore have no associated data. Also, in some circumstances sample sizes for particular habitat/parent material combinations were insufficient to estimate mean values.BPI Zones are derived from gridded (40 m cell size) multibeam bathymetry, collected aboard R/V AHI and NOAA ship Hi'ialakai.

As a follow-up to the expedition mounted by OE in June 2003, this field program, with Dr. Robert Ballard and colleagues from OE and other institutions, proposes to re-survey the wreck using state-of-the-art imagery and communications equipment and to broadcast the data real-time via their Inner Space technology. This updated research will help to better determine the wreck?s rate of degradation, produce the first ever comprehensive map of the entire wreck site, and actively engage the public with live video and communication links via the Internet. IFE plans to use its tandem ROV team of Argus and Little Hercules to provide an accurate high-definition map of the wreck site with video imagery. The pair was effectively used in NOAA?s Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary in 2002, where they used high-definition imagery to visually survey more than a dozen wrecks in Lake Huron. IFE will incorporate new methods and technology recently used in their successful Black Sea 2003 Expedition to accurately map the area and coordinate with satellite facilities to transmit the data. Both vehicles will be modified to operate in deep water. In addition, another ROV, Hercules, which was designed explicitly for deep-water archaeological site mapping, can also be modified for biological sampling and precision mapping at the depths of Titanic. Also joining the cruise will be marine biologists, who will continue to conduct rusticle research and bacterial experiments to determine whether or not the current level of microbial activity is the leading cause of the wreck?s degradation. These investigations have proven directly useful to other deep-sea experiments throughout the world, namely marine construction projects and pharmaceutical research.NeuroLex (en)EuroCRIS EuroCRIS DSpace repositoryLibrary Catalog may include: Data Management Plans, Cruise Plans, Cruise Summary Reports, Scientific "Quick Look Reports", Video Annotation Logs, Image Collections, Highlight Images, Video Collections, Highlight Video Clips, Dive Plans, Dive Summary Reports, Maps, Essays, News Articles, Presentations, Education Lesson Plans, Biographies, Web Logs/Summaries.Benthic monitoring of the sea bed adjacent to the fish farm as a requirement of the CAR licence for the site.

The goal of the work was to develop coral reef mapping methods and compare benthic habitat maps generated by photointerpreting georeferenced color aerial photography, hyperspectral and IKONOS satellite imagery. The cost effectiveness of acquisition and processing of remotely sensed imagery varies significantly between types of platforms deployed and imaging systems used to acquire the data. As a result, it is important to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the map products prepared from each of the types of digital imagery. These Accuracy Assessment point data were generated to assess the accuracy of the individual maps created from the three types of source information.Testing showed that the ability to generate benthic habitat maps with an overall accuracy of 90% to 95% confidence interval is reaching a threshold using imagery with three meter pixel size allowing for spectral enhancement of the imagery with reduced resolution. Increasing the intensity of field observation can partially compensate for this decrease in accuracy of the maps generated from the largest pixels. Habitat maps prepared from IKONOS satellite imagery should be accompanied by field observation wherever possible.Consistent, real-time water data from streams, lakes, reservoirs, ground-water, and meteorological sites, are available from the USGS National Water Information System as graphs, tables, or files to download.GEOTRACES, An International Study of Marine Biogeochemical Cycles of Trace Elements and their IsotopesThe NOAA Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) produces national standardized land cover and change products for the coastal regions of the U.S. C-CAP products inventory coastal intertidal areas, wetlands, and adjacent uplands with the goal of monitoring changes in these habitats, on a one-to-five year repeat cycle. The timeframe for this metadata is reported as 2006-Era, but the actual dates of the Landsat imagery used to create the land cover may have been acquired a few years before or after each era. These maps are developed utilizing Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery, and can be used to track changes in the landscape through time. This trend information gives important feedback to managers on the success or failure of management policies and programs and aid in developing a scientific understanding of the Earth system and its response to natural and human-induced changes. This understanding allows for the prediction of impacts due to these changes and the assessment of their cumulative effects, helping coastal resource managers make more informed regional decisions. NOAA C-CAP is a contributing member to the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics consortium and C-CAP products are included as the coastal expression of land cover within the National Land Cover Database.The TIGER/Line shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. The Feature Names Relationship File (FEATNAMES.dbf) contains a record for each feature name and any attributes associated with it. Each feature name can be linked to the corresponding edges that make up that feature in the All Lines Shapefile (EDGES.shp), where applicable to the corresponding address range or ranges in the Address Ranges Relationship File (ADDR.dbf), or to both files. Although this file includes feature names for all linear features, not just road features, the primary purpose of this relationship file is to identify all street names associated with each address range. An edge can have several feature names; an address range located on an edge can be associated with one or any combination of the available feature names (an address range can be linked to multiple feature names). The address range is identified by the address range identifier (ARID) attribute, which can be used to link to the Address Ranges Relationship File (ADDR.dbf). The linear feature is identified by the linear feature identifier (LINEARID) attribute, which can be used to relate the address range back to the name attributes of the feature in the Feature Names Relationship File or to the feature record in the Primary Roads, Primary and Secondary Roads, or All Roads Shapefiles. The edge to which a feature name applies can be determined by linking the feature name record to the All Lines Shapefile (EDGES.shp) using the permanent edge identifier (TLID) attribute. The address range identifier(s) (ARID) for a specific linear feature can be found by using the linear feature identifier (LINEARID) from the Feature Names Relationship File (FEATNAMES.dbf) through the Address Range / Feature Name Relationship File (ADDRFN.dbf).The TIGER/Line shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB).

Applied Signal Technology (AST) has combined their SAS with the MacArtney FOCUS-2 ROTV to create the ultimate towed acoustic imaging device, PROSAS Surveyor. Capable of an area coverage rate of 2.5 kilometer/hour with a resolution of 3 centimeters, PROSAS Surveyor will greatly expand capabilities to locate even the oldest archaeological sites on the continental shelf, particularly where sedimentation is limited. Large area seafloor mapping at a resolution capable of imaging very small targets is a tremendously expensive proposition for submerged land managers responsible for bottom lands from 30 to 300 meters in depth. Daily operating costs for a suitable research vessel and personnel limit the area that can be investigated. This project will for the first time apply commercially available SAS technology to the search for historic shipwrecks. The rapidity and resolution of this project's survey will be as much as a four-fold increase in area covered as compared to conventional marine archaeological remote sensing survey.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

More than 150 limestone caves are known to exist in or near the island of Bermuda. Many of these caves have extensive but relatively shallow submerged portions that connect to the sea via tidal springs along the coastline. These inland caves are inhabited by a number of diverse eyeless and colorless crustaceans and other invertebrates. Many of these organisms are "living fossils"; and some are most closely related to deep-sea organisms. While previous investigations of marine caves have been limited to those within shallow depths (less than 50 meters/164 feet), current research suggests that caves can occur at almost any depth within the sea. The geological history of Bermuda, coupled with biological evidence (cave-adapted species), indicates a strong possibility for the presence of deep-water caves near the island. Thus, Bermuda offers an idea location to search for and to study deep-water caves.This Web Coverage Service (WCS) is one of the multiple MODAPS data service instances used to provide gridded Level 3 daily MODAPS data products.

Five older, less accurate, overlapping surveys wereomitted before tinning. The average separation between soundings was 37meters. The three surveys used dated from 1993 and 1994. The total range ofsounding data was 1.5 meters to -18.9 meters at mean low water. A mean highwater value of 1.1 meters was assigned to the shoreline. Two points were foundthat were not consistent with the surrounding data and were removed priorto tinning. DEM grid values outside the shoreline (on land) wereassigned null values (-32676).Tomales Bay has four 7.5 minute DEMs and a single one degree DEM. The1 degree DEMs were generated from the higher resolution 7.5 minuteDEMs which covered the estuary. A Digital Elevation Model (DEM)contains a series of elevations ordered from south to north with theorder of the columns from west to east. The DEM is formatted as oneASCII header record (A- record), followed by a series of profilerecords (B- records) each of which include a short B-record headerfollowed by a series of ASCII integer elevations (typically in unitsof 1 centimeter) per each profile. The last physical record of theDEM is an accuracy record (C-record).The 7.5-minute DEM (30- by 30-m data spacing) is cast on theUniversal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection. It provides coveragein 7.5- by 7.5-minute blocks. Each product provides the samecoverage as a standard USGS 7.5-minute quadrangle but the DEMcontains over edge data. Coverage is available for many estuaries ofthe contiguous United States but is not complete.The High Plains aquifer underlies 111.4 million acres (174,000 square miles) in parts of eight States-Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming.

The NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service Mississippi Laboratories at Pascagoula and Stennis Space Center and the NOAA National Coastal Data Development Center (NCDDC) at Stennis Space Center began the Hypoxia Watch project in 2001. Scientists aboard the NOAA Research Vessel Oregon II measure seawater properties, such as water temperature, salinity, chlorophyll, and dissolved oxygen at each of approximately 240 locations as the Oregon II cruises the waters south of Pascagoula, MS and then makes its way from Brownsville, Texas, to the mouth of the Mississippi River. A scientist aboard the ship processes the measurements from electronic dissolved oxygen sensors, checks the measurements periodically with chemical analyses of the seawater, then sends the data by e-mail to NCDDC at Stennis Space Center approximately every three to five days. Physical Scientists at NCDDC transform the dissolved oxygen measurements into contour maps, which identify areas of low oxygen, or hypoxia. During the 6-week cruise, as the data is received from the ship, NCDDC generates new maps and immediately publishes them on the web. The first map will usually cover an area off the Mississippi coast, successive maps will add areas of the continental shelf from Brownsville to Galveston, and the final map will usually cover the entire Texas-Louisiana-Mississippi coast. Maps are published every three to five days from approximately June 10 to July 20.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

Similar to other trip ticket invoice systems, except that compliance is voluntary and invoices are only provided to dealers, hotel, stores, fish mobiles etc. on the island of Saipan. Participation has deteriorated in recent years as the economy has suffered and businesses have failed and struggled to stay in existence. DFW has always run the system and have efforts underway to improve compliance and actually make such commercial vendor reporting mandatory through local legislation (although this has been tried in the past and failed). Data are collected by vendor and may include a fishermen?s identity (or not) and include number of pieces, weight, and price for some individual species and some species groups. Data exist back to about 1983 and are continuing, although the relative coverage of the fisheries has varied over the time series.

The timeframe for this metadata is reported as 2006-Era, but the actual dates of the Landsat imagery used to create the land cover may have been acquired a few years before or after each era. These maps are developed utilizing Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery, and can be used to track changes in the landscape through time. This trend information gives important feedback to managers on the success or failure of management policies and programs and aid in developing a scientific understanding of the Earth system and its response to natural and human-induced changes. This understanding allows for the prediction of impacts due to these changes and the assessment of their cumulative effects, helping coastal resource managers make more informed regional decisions.

An orthoimage is a uniform-scale image where corrections have been made for feature displacement such as building tilt and for scale variations caused by terrain relief, sensor geometry, and camera tilt. A mathematical equation based on ground control points, sensor calibration information, and a digital elevation model is applied to each pixel to rectify the image to obtain the geometric qualities of a map. A digital orthoimage may be created from several photographs mosaicked to form the final image. The source imagery may be black-and-white, natural color, color infrared, or color near infrared (4-band) with a pixel resolution of 1-meter or finer. With orthoimagery, the resolution refers to the distance on the ground represented by each pixel. There is no image overlap between adjacent files. Data received at EROS were reprojected from source projection to a standard utm projection and resolution resampled to align to the U.S. National Grid (USNG) using The National Map.

The datasets were downloaded from logger memory using Japanese research submersibles at irregular intervals of 1-2 years. Currently there are 14 total datasets as follows: downloads at 808I in 2002, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2011, and 2012; downloads at 1173B in 2002, 2004, 2006, 2007, 2011, and 2012. They should be of interest to scientists studying seismogenic processes at subduction zones. Please note that much of the data from 808I may be compromised by the lack of seal for the central bore. In addition, several of the valves on both installations were bumped open by a reentry camera frame during deployment, so the first year's installment of data from both sites was compromised until the valves were closed during the 2002 Kaiko operations. There are separate data files for each of the downloads. Each data file has a header of basic metadata that describes the contents of the columns and the respective checks on logger clock drift. Typically, the clock drift was checked just before each download, and the clocks were then reset to UTC immediately after the respective downloads. In three cases, the records of the logger times checks have been misplaced and the drifts computed from other clock checks (consistent from year to year at each site, order 1-2 minutes per year) are reported. Note that the times in the data files have not been corrected for the clock drift. Also, during some of the download operations, there were attempts to calibrate the relative offsets among gauges by opening the seafloor valves to apply seafloor pressure to all the gauges. These are not reflected in the main data files. The installations have battery power for 10-15 years of operation, longer with planned addition of supplemental batteries, so there should be future downloads to add to the archive. There are likely to be future JAMSTEC download opportunities at unpredictable intervals, hopefully every 1-2 years. At approximately 5 Mb/yr, future datasets should be approximately 5-10 Mb in size.Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI) maps are an integral component in oil-spill contingency planning and assessment. They serve as a source of information in the event of an oil spill incident. ESI maps contain three types of information: shoreline habitats (classified according to their sensitivity to oiling), sensitive biological resources, and human-use resources. Most often, this information is plotted on 7.5 minute USGS quadrangles, although in the Alaska ESI maps, USGS topographic maps at scales of 1:63,360 and 1:250,000 are used, and in other ESI maps, NOAA charts have been used as the base map. Collections of these maps, grouped by state or a logical geographic area, are published as ESI atlases. Digital data have been published for most of the U.S. shoreline, including Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.WMSThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

NCDC has analyzed and assigned RSI values to over 500 storms going as far back as 1900. New storms are added operationally. As such, RSI puts the regional impacts of snowstorms into a century-scale historical perspective. The RSI differs from other indices because it includes population. RSI is based on the spatial extent of the storm, the amount of snowfall, and the juxtaposition of these elements with population. The area and population are cumulative values above regional specific thresholds. For example, the thresholds for the Southeast are 2", 5", 10", and 15" of snowfall while the thresholds for the Northeast are 4", 10", 20", and 30" of snowfall. Population information ties the index to societal impacts. Currently, the index uses population based on the 2000 Census. The RSI is an evolution of the Northeast Snowfall Impact Scale (NESIS) which NCDC began producing operationally in 2005. While NESIS was developed for storms that had a major impact in the Northeast, it includes the impact of snow on other regions as well. It can be thought of as a quasi-national index that is calibrated to Northeast snowstorms. By contrast, the RSI is a regional index; a separate index is produced for each of the six NCDC climate regions in the eastern two-thirds of the nation. The indices are calculated in a similar fashion to NESIS, but our experience has led us to propose a change in the methodology. The new indices require region-specific parameters and thresholds for the calculations. For details on how RSI is calculated, see Squires et al. 2011.Information concerning status and trends of biological resources, focusing on river and stream ecosystemsThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

The National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) started the GEFS to address the nature of uncertainty in weather observations, which are used to initialize weather forecast models. The proverbial butterfly flapping her wings can have a cascading effect leading to wind gusts thousands of miles away. This extreme example illustrates that tiny, unnoticeable differences between reality and what is actually measured can, over time, lead to noticeable differences between what a weather model forecast predicts and reality itself. The GEFS attempts to quantify the amount of uncertainty in a forecast by generating an ensemble of multiple forecasts, each minutely different, or perturbed, from the original observations. With global coverage, GEFS is produced four times a day with weather forecasts going out to 16 days and a 6 hour temporal resolution. This dataset has 1.0 degree horizontal resolution.TIGER, TIGER/Line, and Census TIGER are registered trademarks of the Bureau of the Census. The Redistricting Census 2000 TIGER/Line files are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the Census TIGER data base. The geographic coverage for a single TIGER/Line file is a county or statistical equivalent entity, with the coverage area based on January 1, 2000 legal boundaries. A complete set of Redistricting Census 2000 TIGER/Line files includes all counties and statistically equivalent entities in the United States and Puerto Rico. The Redistricting Census 2000 TIGER/Line files will not include files for the Island Areas. The Census TIGER data base represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts. However, each county-based TIGER/Line file is designed to stand alone as an independent data set or the files can be combined to cover the whole Nation. The Redistricting Census 2000 TIGER/Line files consist of line segments representing physical features and governmental and statistical boundaries. The Redistricting Census 2000 TIGER/Line files do NOT contain the ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) and the address ranges are of approximately the same vintage as those appearing in the 1999 TIGER/Line files. That is, the Census Bureau is producing the Redistricting Census 2000 TIGER/Line files in advance of the computer processing that will ensure that the address ranges in the TIGER/Line files agree with the final Master Address File (MAF) used for tabulating Census 2000. The files contain information distributed over a series of record types for the spatial objects of a county. There are 17 record types, including the basic data record, the shape coordinate points, and geographic codes that can be used with appropriate software to prepare maps. Other geographic information contained in the files includes attributes such as feature identifiers/census feature class codes (CFCC) used to differentiate feature types, address ranges and ZIP Codes, codes for legal and statistical entities, latitude/longitude coordinates of linear and point features, landmark point features, area landmarks, key geographic features, and area boundaries.

Sea floor data collected were high-resolution multibeam bathymetry and side-scan sonar (on selected lines). Subsurface data were gathered using a surface tow boomer (on selected lines). The multibeam data collected on this survey were later merged with data from the 2004 survey and this combined dataset is available with the 2004 survey. Most of the data were recorded digitally. Some paper records were also generated also. These data are archived with the MEDIN Data Archive Centres (DAC), including the BGS DAC for geology and geophysics and the UKHO DAC for bathymetry data. Technical details of the survey are contained in BGS Cruise report IR/04/012. For further information on the surveys and general information on the OBCMHS see the final report (Mackie et al, 2006.

The positions of these CORS sites help define the National Spatial Reference System (NSRS). NGS defines and manages the NSRS - the framework for latitude, longitude, height, scale, gravity, orientation and shoreline throughout the U.S. The NSRS provides a consistent national coordinate system to support mapping, charting, navigation, boundary determination, property delineation, infrastructure development, resource evaluation surveys, and scientific applications. The CORS system enables positional accuracies that approach a few centimeters relative to the NSRS, both horizontally and vertically.This georeferenced image represents 10 meter resolution multibeam bathymetry of Grammanik Bank, south of St. Thomas, US Virgin Islands. NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Team, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory, federal, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data in the US Virgin Islands from 2/1/05 to 2/12/05. Data was acquired with a pole-mounted Reson 8101 ER multibeam echosounder (240 kHz) and processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS v5.4 software. Data has all correctors applied (attitude, sound velocity) and has been reduced to mean lower low water (MLLW) using final approved tides from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM zone 20 north, datum NAD83. The processed CARIS data was used to generate a CARIS BASE surface -akin to a DTM- based on swath angle. Within CARIS, an imagery file with associated georeferencing was then exported from the BASE surface.The project was conducted to meet IHO Order 1 and 2 accuracy standards, dependant on the project area and depth.

However, this is largely speculative and is based on few data, a troubling fact considering the importance of sex ratios when modeling the status of marine turtle populations. Marine turtles exhibit temperature sex determination (TSD), such that the overall sex ratio of hatchlings produced on a nesting beach is affected by the incubation temperatures on that beach (Mrosovsky and Yntema 1980, Rimblot et al. 1985). This creates unique susceptibility of marine turtles to global climate change and deforestation at nesting beaches (Hawkes et al. 2007). And although research has shown that the temperature threshold may vary among species and beaches, there are relatively few studies on hatchling sex ratios (Chevalier et al. 1999, Wibbels 2003, Mrosovsky et al. 2009). Considering the extreme importance of knowing sex ratio when modeling population abundance and trends, it is essential to conduct studies to determine sex ratio at various nesting beaches. In this study, we proposed to monitor thermal environments at the St. Croix, USVI, leatherback turtle nesting beach and the Bahia de Jiquilisco-Xiriualtique Biosphere Reserve in El Salvador for hawksbill turtles.USGS Coastal Marine Geology field activitiesScientists from NOAA Fisheries Service's Benthic Resources Group and NOAA Center for Coastal Environmental Health and Biomolecular Research participated in a six-day (November 1-6, 2010) research cruise aboard NOAA's newest Fisheries Survey Vessel (FSV), the Bell M.

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. The Address Ranges Relationship File (ADDR.dbf) contains the attributes of each address range. Each address range applies to a single edge and has a unique address range identifier (ARID) value. The edge to which an address range applies can be determined by linking the address range to the All Lines Shapefile (EDGES.shp) using the permanent topological edge identifier (TLID) attribute. Multiple address ranges can apply to the same edge since an edge can have multiple address ranges. Note that the most inclusive address range associated with each side of a street edge already appears in the All Lines Shapefile (EDGES.shp). The TIGER/Line Shapefiles contain potential address ranges, not individual addresses. The term "address range" refers to the collection of all possible structure numbers from the first structure number to the last structure number and all numbers of a specified parity in between along an edge side relative to the direction in which the edge is coded. The address ranges in the TIGER/Line Shapefiles are potential ranges that include the full range of possible structure numbers even though the actual structures may not exist.Explains how we use chromium, the types of mineral deposits in which we find it, and the economic factors affecting supply and demand of this commodity.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

IODP was an international marine research program that explored Earth's history and structure recorded in seafloor sediments and rocks, and monitors subseafloor environments, building upon the earlier successes of the Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) and Ocean Drilling Program (ODP), which revolutionized our view of Earth history and global processes through ocean basin exploration. IODP expanded the reach of these previous programs by using multiple drilling platforms, including riser, riserless, and mission-specific, to achieve its scientific goals. The IODP was funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation and several countries, only the U.S. component of IODP data is represented in this archive. In 2010, the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) began receiving core data processed through the JANUS data system at TAMU for long-term archival, beginning with Expedition 301. In 2013, the first data from the new LIMS data system at TAMU reached the archive, beginning with Expedition 317. In addition to digital core data from the JANUS and LIMS systems, which is available online, core images and other scanned documents and images are also archived.

The drainage areas are nested within each other so that a large drainage area, such as the Upper Mississippi River, will be composed of multiple smaller drainage areas, such as the Wisconsin River. Each of these smaller areas can further be subdivided into smaller and smaller drainage areas. The WBD uses six different levels in this hierarchy, with the smallest averaging about 30,000 acres. The WBD is made up of polygons nested into six levels of data respectively defined by Regions, Subregions, Basins, Subbasins, Watersheds, and Subwatersheds. For additional information on the WBD, go to http://nhd.usgs.gov/wbd.html. The USGS National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) service is a companion dataset to the WBD. The NHD is a comprehensive set of digital spatial data that encodes information about naturally occurring and constructed bodies of surface water (lakes, ponds, and reservoirs), paths through which water flows (canals, ditches, streams, and rivers), and related entities such as point features (springs, wells, stream gages, and dams). The information encoded about these features includes classification and other characteristics, delineation, geographic name, position and related measures, a "reach code" through which other information can be related to the NHD, and the direction of water flow. The network of reach codes delineating water and transported material flow allows users to trace movement in upstream and downstream directions. In addition to this geographic information, the dataset contains metadata that supports the exchange of future updates and improvements to the data. The NHD is available nationwide in two seamless datasets, one based on 1:24,000-scale maps and referred to as high resolution NHD, and the other based on 1:100,000-scale maps and referred to as medium resolution NHD. Additional selected areas in the United States are available based on larger scales, such as 1:5,000-scale or greater, and referred to as local resolution NHD. For more information on the NHD, go to http://nhd.usgs.gov/index.html. Hydrography data from The National Map supports many applications, such as making maps, geocoding observations, flow modeling, data maintenance, and stewardship. Hydrography data is commonly combined with other data themes, such as boundaries, elevation, structures, and transportation, to produce general reference base maps.

This track was based on the hourly ship's position from the Virtual Instrument Data System (VIDS) provided by the University of Miami Marine Technology Group at Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution.These images were created by combining the estimates of the mean bottom to surface temperature differences to produce seasonal representations for winter, spring, summer and fall. Winter includes the months of January, February and March; spring includes the months of April, May and June; summer includes the months of July, August and September; fall includes the months of October, November and December. Estimates of bottom to surface temperature differences (Delta t) were originally obtained from the Naval Research Laboratory at the Stennis Space Center (NRL/SSC). NRL/SSC derived these estimates from a reanalysis of NRL/SSC Intra-Americas Sea Ocean Nowcast/Forecast System (IASNFS). The NRL IASNFS is a 3-dimensional circulation model based on the Navy Coast Model (NCOM) (Ko et al. 2003). The model has a 1/24 degree resolution or about ~5.8 km at the northern Gulf of Mexico and 40 vertical layers. It covers the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea and uses Navy Global NCOM for the open boundary conditions. IASNFS assimilates satellite altimeter data from GFO, Jason-1, ERS-1/2, EnviSat and TOPEX and sea surface temperature from NOAA AVHRR and MODIS (Ko et al. 2008). The surface forcing includes wind, heat fluxes and sea level air-pressure derived from Navy operational global weather forecast model NOGAPS. The temperature differences were calculated from temperature at surface layer and at bottom layer or to 100 m depth and interpolated onto a 2 minute grid for northern Gulf Coast.The Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) radio telescope.The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) contracted with Hawaii-based Aerial Surveying, Inc. to collect lidar-derived elevation data over the low-lying areas within the northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) during the summer of 2010. A separate contract issued to Aerial Surveying, Inc. by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) funded the lidar data processing and elevation data product development phases of the project. Lidar data provide high resolution digital elevation models that are used for many applications, including but not limited to sea level rise modeling, habitat assessments, and tsunami inundation modeling. In April 2011, NOAA Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument and NOAA Coastal Services Center deployed a survey crew to the NWHI to collect high accuracy point data to validate the 2010 lidar data. The survey crew used survey-grade Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers to collect high accuracy elevation points. This metadata covers the information for Midway Atoll. This dataset contains lidar point clouds in LAS 1.2 format, classified in the following ASPRS standards as Class 1: Unclassified, Class 2: Ground, and Class 9: Water. The following are the equipment used to create the lidar data sets. Aircraft: Beechcraft Queen Air Lidar Systems: Riegl 140 and 240 Accuracy statements are based on areas of open terrain, with points classified as ground. The accuracy of each point is expected to meet the vertical accuracy standard, derived products may be less accurate in areas of extreme terrain and dense vegetation due to a lesser number of points defining the ground in these areas. Classified data sets such as this one may have varying posting due to some pulses not reaching the ground.

The Redistricting Census 2000 TIGER/Line files are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the Census TIGER data base. The geographic coverage for a single TIGER/Line file is a county or statistical equivalent entity, with the coverage area based on January 1, 2000 legal boundaries. A complete set of Redistricting Census 2000 TIGER/Line files includes all counties and statistically equivalent entities in the United States and Puerto Rico. The Redistricting Census 2000 TIGER/Line files will not include files for the Island Areas. The Census TIGER data base represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts. However, each county-based TIGER/Line file is designed to stand alone as an independent data set or the files can be combined to cover the whole Nation. The Redistricting Census 2000 TIGER/Line files consist of line segments representing physical features and governmental and statistical boundaries. The Redistricting Census 2000 TIGER/Line files do NOT contain the ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) and the address ranges are of approximately the same vintage as those appearing in the 1999 TIGER/Line files. That is, the Census Bureau is producing the Redistricting Census 2000 TIGER/Line files in advance of the computer processing that will ensure that the address ranges in the TIGER/Line files agree with the final Master Address File (MAF) used for tabulating Census 2000. The files contain information distributed over a series of record types for the spatial objects of a county. There are 17 record types, including the basic data record, the shape coordinate points, and geographic codes that can be used with appropriate software to prepare maps. Other geographic information contained in the files includes attributes such as feature identifiers/census feature class codes (CFCC) used to differentiate feature types, address ranges and ZIP Codes, codes for legal and statistical entities, latitude/longitude coordinates of linear and point features, landmark point features, area landmarks, key geographic features, and area boundaries.

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. The TIGER/Line Files include both incorporated places (legal entities) and census designated places or CDPs (statistical entities). An incorporated place is established to provide governmental functions for a concentration of people as opposed to a minor civil division (MCD), which generally is created to provide services or administer an area without regard, necessarily, to population. Places always nest within a State, but may extend across county and county subdivision boundaries. An incorporated place usually is a city, town, village, or borough, but can have other legal descriptions. CDPs are delineated for the decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places. CDPs are delineated to provide data for settled concentrations of population that are identifiable by name, but are not legally incorporated under the laws of the State in which they are located. The boundaries for CDPs often are defined in partnership with State, local, and/or tribal officials and usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or another legal entity. CDP boundaries often change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern and development; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary. The only population/housing size requirement for CDPs for the 2010 Census is that they must contain some housing and population. The boundaries of all 2010 Census incorporated places are as of January 1, 2010 as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS). The boundaries of all 2010 Census CDPs were delineated as part of the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP).MARIS is an internet-based information sharing network that allows multiple states to provide a common set of variables via a single web interface.

Collectors included George Boehlert, Bruce Mundy, Ilse Hamann, Donald Kobayashi, Christopher Wilson, Ronald Yoshimoto, William Watson, and Christine Thacker. Plankton and midwater trawl samples were taken in the vicinity of Palmyra Atoll. Larvae were sampled below the surface with a 1 m2 multiple opening-closing net and environmental sensing system (MOCNESS), a 1 m diameter dropped ring net and light trap (in the atoll lagoon), and at the sea surface with a 0.49 m2 Manta net modified to take surface samples to a depth of 0.7 m. All plankton nets were constructed of 0.333 mm Nitex mesh. Estimates of water volumes filtered by both gear types were based on mechanical flowmeter readings. Samples were taken at a variety of depths. MOCNESS hauls were 12 minutes duration for each net (in 1990 targeting strata of 0-20, 20-40, 40-60, 60-80, 80-100, 100-120, 120-160, and 160-200 m; in 1992 targeting strata at 0-30, 30-60, and 60-100 m, with a few additional samples at 100-130 m), fished in a stepped oblique fashion from deep to shallow with mean tow speeds of approximately 75 cm/sec; the tow speed was adjusted to maintain a net mouth angle near 45". Neuston tows (0-0.75 m) were 24 minutes, taken during the mid-point of the MOCNESS tows. The drop net was used in the lagoon, targeting vertical samples at 0-10, 0-20, and 0-30 m. The light trap fished at the surface in the atoll lagoon at night. Juvenile fish were sampled with a Cobb Midwater trawl and a 1.8 m mouth-width Isaacs-Kidd midwater trawl, targeting depths of 0-120 m. All fish larvae and juveniles were identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible by Bruce C. Mundy.These data contain basic information describing well logs and compiled by the Texas Bureau of Economic Geology, published as a downloadable file, ESRI Service, and as a Web Feature service for the National Geothermal Data System.

Some of this data is used in forecasts of juvenile salmon returns, and it is also helping to make possible some preliminary evaluations of hatchery wild interactions and other density-dependent questions. 0.5 m Vertical and 0.6 m Oblique Bongo TowsDesert surfaces are inherently fragile, and many land uses disrupt the thin crusts that typically protect the landscape from wind and water erosion. Depiction of the vulnerability of soils to wind erosion requires development of a wind-erosion GIS model, measurement of wind speed, direction, and duration at specific sites, experimentation using portable wind tunnels on disturbed and undisturbed geomorphic surfaces, and the development of GIS data layers depicting wind potential and other factors related to wind erosion. Increased water-erosion potential following disturbances is an important part of landscape vulnerability, and quantification of sediment yields allows an assessment of the natural variability in water-transported sediment and organic material, including seeds of native and non-native plants. One of the key landscape elements that minimizes both wind and water erosion is the presence and types of cryptobiotic crusts mantling soil surfaces. Soil crusts are an important process control on surficial erosion and also influence wind dispersal of vascular plants. A regional assessment will be conducted of the distribution and species composition of crusts, as well as their fragility to disturbance.Technical description of methods used to generate global slope data from SRTM topography dataLibrary Catalog may include: Data Management Plans, Cruise Plans, Cruise Summary Reports, Scientific "Quick Look Reports", Video Annotation Logs, Image Collections, Highlight Images, Video Collections, Highlight Video Clips, Dive Plans, Dive Summary Reports, Maps, Essays, News Articles, Presentations, Education Lesson Plans, Biographies, Web Logs/Summaries.Consistent, historic, and up-to-date ground-water data, such as water levels collected at wells and springs, are available from the USGS National Water Information System as graphs, tables, or files to download.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

The datasets were downloaded from logger memory using Japanese research submersibles at irregular intervals of 1-2 years. Currently there are 14 total datasets as follows: downloads at 808I in 2002, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2011, and 2012; downloads at 1173B in 2002, 2004, 2006, 2007, 2011, and 2012. They should be of interest to scientists studying seismogenic processes at subduction zones. Please note that much of the data from 808I may be compromised by the lack of seal for the central bore. In addition, several of the valves on both installations were bumped open by a reentry camera frame during deployment, so the first year's installment of data from both sites was compromised until the valves were closed during the 2002 Kaiko operations. There are separate data files for each of the downloads. Each data file has a header of basic metadata that describes the contents of the columns and the respective checks on logger clock drift. Typically, the clock drift was checked just before each download, and the clocks were then reset to UTC immediately after the respective downloads. In three cases, the records of the logger times checks have been misplaced and the drifts computed from other clock checks (consistent from year to year at each site, order 1-2 minutes per year) are reported. Note that the times in the data files have not been corrected for the clock drift. Also, during some of the download operations, there were attempts to calibrate the relative offsets among gauges by opening the seafloor valves to apply seafloor pressure to all the gauges. These are not reflected in the main data files. The installations have battery power for 10-15 years of operation, longer with planned addition of supplemental batteries, so there should be future downloads to add to the archive. There are likely to be future JAMSTEC download opportunities at unpredictable intervals, hopefully every 1-2 years. At approximately 5 Mb/yr, future datasets should be approximately 5-10 Mb in size.Search the current edition of the CatalogWMSClimate Prediction Center (CPC) Palmer Drought Severity and Crop Moisture Indices are computed for the 344 U.S. Climate Divisions on a weekly basis based on a minimum of the previous 4 weeks (1 month) of observed temperatures and precipitation. Each climate division record includes a weekly averaged atmospheric temperature, precipitation, soil moisture in the upper and lower layers, percentage of flood capacity, potential evaporation, runoff, crop moisture and change from previous week, monthly moisture anomaly, preliminary or final Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), and precipitation needed to end drought value. The CPC preliminary data are collected in near real-time from ground stations throughout the U.S., and are displayed in tabular form. The preliminary values are replaced by quality controlled data from the National Climatic Data Center with an approximate time lag of 3 to 6 months.The NOAA Hypoxia Watch project provides near-real-time, web-based maps of dissolved oxygen near the sea floor over the Texas-Louisiana continental shelf during a period that extends from early June to mid-July. The NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service Mississippi Laboratories at Pascagoula and Stennis Space Center and the NOAA National Coastal Data Development Center (NCDDC) at Stennis Space Center began the Hypoxia Watch project in 2001. Scientists aboard the NOAA Research Vessel Oregon II measure seawater properties, such as water temperature, salinity, chlorophyll, and dissolved oxygen at each of approximately 240 locations as the Oregon II cruises the waters south of Pascagoula, MS and then makes its way from Brownsville, Texas, to the mouth of the Mississippi River. A scientist aboard the ship processes the measurements from electronic dissolved oxygen sensors, checks the measurements periodically with chemical analyses of the seawater, then sends the data by e-mail to NCDDC at Stennis Space Center approximately every three to five days. Physical Scientists at NCDDC transform the dissolved oxygen measurements into contour maps, which identify areas of low oxygen, or hypoxia. During the 6-week cruise, as the data is received from the ship, NCDDC generates new maps and immediately publishes them on the web. The first map will usually cover an area off the Mississippi coast, successive maps will add areas of the continental shelf from Brownsville to Galveston, and the final map will usually cover the entire Texas-Louisiana-Mississippi coast. Maps are published every three to five days from approximately June 10 to July 20.As used in this assessment, "fire weather" is analogous to "extreme fire weather potential" used by Schmidt et al. (2002). The 3 main components of fire weather include temperature, humidity, and wind. We used average maximum temperature and average humidity (vapor pressure) for the month of August from DAYMET (http://www.ntsg.umt.edu/); and average surface wind speed for August from the ICBEMP (www.icbemp.gov). These data were 1000-m and 9317-m resolution, respectively. We "smoothed" the wind data by resampling it to 1000-m resolution so that it would have a similar resolution as the temperature and humidity data. A proxy for fire weather was then generated spatially by averaging the standardized values for the 3 weather variables: Wx_potential = (max_temp + (1- rel_humidity) + rel_wind_ros) / 3SourceWatch (en)Description of three types of severe coastal storm impacts: hurricane impacts on the southeast U.S., extra-tropical storm impacts on the U.S. west coast during El-Nino winters, and 'northeaster' impacts on the U.S. east coast.This data shows the boundaries of the DNR Division of Forestry administrative Areas for the State of MinnesotaTOMS_AI_G is an aerosol related dataset derived from the Total Ozone Monitoring Satellite (TOMS) Sensor.

Version 3 was released in September 2012 with the addition of data from two additional station networks. Changes to the processing system associated with the version 3 release also allowed for updates to occur 7 days a week rather than only on most weekdays. Version 3 contains station-based measurements from well over 90,000 land-based stations worldwide, about two thirds of which are for precipitation measurement only. Other meteorological elements include, but are not limited to, daily maximum and minimum temperature, temperature at the time of observation, snowfall and snow depth. Over 25,000 stations are regularly updated with observations from within roughly the last month. The dataset is also routinely reconstructed (usually every week) from its roughly 30 data sources to ensure that GHCN-Daily is generally in sync with its growing list of constituent sources. During this process, quality assurance checks are applied to the full dataset. Where possible, GHCN-Daily station data are also updated daily from a variety of data streams. Station values for each daily update also undergo a suite of quality checks.This layer contains data describing well headers in the state of Wisconsin, obtained by the AASG for the Geothermal Data Project.

Operations Report on Project 81/05. A Geophysical Survey in the Eastern English Channel. (IGS Report No 121) There were two objectives of this project, the first being to complete the regional survey of the Dungeness-Boulogne sheet of the IGS 1:250000 map series. The second objective was to carry out a gravity and megnetic survey in the Caen and Rouen sheets, in order to complete the gravity coverage of the entire English Channel. A secondary objective was to run a few isolated gravity lines in Bournemouth Bay and off Dartmouth to fill in small gaps in the existing data.This Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the bedrock surface elevation in Iowa was compiled using all available data, principally information from GEOSAM, supplemented with well and boring information from the Iowa DOT, exposure reports from Iowa Geological & Water Survey reports and files, and the Department of Soil Conservation county soil maps for Iowa. The soil maps were especially valuable, since they identified soils that encountered bedrock within the soil horizon, and less dependably also spot-located rock exposures. A 50 foot contour interval was chosen for the map because it was considered to best represent the accuracy of the well data, allowed for fairly good representation of the bedrock surface in areas with limited well control, and was mappable in high relief areas (the contours packed so close together that it precluded mapping or forced the software to snap-join contours). The 50 foot contour interval also allowed areas where bedrock was present within the soil horizon (2-3 feet) to be treated as areas of exposures. In these areas the bedrock elevation was mapped as only slightly below the surface elevation, so contours on the 7 ' topographic maps were closely followed in mapping the bedrock elevation. Consequently, on the completed map of bedrock elevation, these areas display much more contorted and crenulated contour lines than the areas where only drill control was utilized.WMS Service for RGIS dataset 2013 FEMA Cross Sections (adca193c-7758-46be-90ae-31de439933d6)A compendium of previously published databases and database records that describe PGE, nickel, and chromium deposits and occurrences.Overview of interdisciplinary research studies in Glacier National Park to understand how this mountain wilderness responds to present climatic variability and other external stressors, such as air pollution, and links to detailed reports.Results (*.pdf) of a 1998 targeted reconnaissance survey on the sources of radium, polonium, and lead radionuclides, data collection and laboratory methods, existing occurrences in drinking water, risk assessments, and compliance monitoring.WMSSelection of photographic images of the Long Valley area that illustrate the consequences of the past geologic history of the Sierra Nevada, Long Valley Caldera, the Mono-Inyo Craters volcanic chain, glaciation, and faulting.N/AArsenic and nitrate are the constituents found most commonly at high concentrations in the primary aquifers.

Nine land use/land cover classes, interpreted from high altitude air photos, are recorded for each 40-acre parcel in the state. These classes include: forested; cultivated; water; marsh; urban residential; extractive; pasture and open; urban non-residential or mixed residential; and transportation. MLMIS data sets were created by grid cell coding a value for each 40-acre parcel in the state. The file was later subdivided into 100-meter by 100-meter grid cells and spatially corrected to provide improved geographic reference. However, this processing step does not improve on the 40-acre resolution of the original data set.Lophelia.org is a comprehensive cold-water coral resource, collating information on the deep-sea, cold-water coral ecosystems, biodiversity and key species.

Towboard surveys) are conducted by the Coral Reef Ecosystem Division (CRED) of the NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC) as part of biennial Pacific Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program (RAMP) Cruises. These cruises support NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program (CRCP) long-term goals for sustainable management and conservation of coral reef ecosystems. 15 towboard surveys (38.448 km in length), were conducted at Lisianski Island in the NW Hawaiian Islands from 08 September - 06 October 2000 as part of RAMP Cruise TC0011. Towboard surveys are a good method for obtaining a general description of large reef areas, assessing the status of low-density populations of large-bodied reef fish, large-scale disturbances (e.g., bleaching), general distribution and abundance patterns of macro-invertebrates (e.g., COT, giant clams), and for assessing trends in these populations and metrics. A pair of scuba divers (1 fish and 1 benthic diver) are towed 60 m behind a small survey launch at a speed of 1-2 knots and a depth of approximately 15m. Each survey is 50 min long, covers about 2 km of habitat, and is divided into ten 5-minute survey segments. The fish diver records, to the lowest possible taxon, all large-bodied reef fishes (>50cmTL) seen within 5m either side and 10m in front of the towboard. Length of each individual is estimated to the nearest cm. The fish towboard is also outfitted with a forward-facing digital video camera to record the survey swath. The benthic diver records percent cover of coral and macroalgae, estimates benthic habitat type and complexity, and censuses a suite of benthic macroinvertebrates including Crown of Thorns sea stars and sea urchins. The benthic towboard is equipped with a downward-facing digital still camera which images the benthos at 15 second intervals. These images are analyzed for percent cover of coral, algae, and other benthic components. Both towboards are equipped with SEABIRD SBE-39 temperature/depth sensors set to record at 5 second intervals. Latitude and longitude of each survey track is recorded at 15 second intervals using a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver onboard the tow boat. A layback algorithm is applied to more accurately map the position of the divers with respect to the reef environment. This algorithm calculates the position of the divers based on the position of the tow boat taking into account the length of the tow rope, the depth of the divers, and the curvature of the survey track. This metadata applies to the fish biomass observations.Location and mineralogical characteristics of former mines, prospects, and occurrences of asbestos in the continental US.

Global methane flux from seabed cold seeps has only been estimated for continental shelves, at 8 to 65 Tg CH4 yr 1, yet other parts of marine continental margins are also emitting methane. The US Atlantic margin has not been considered an area of widespread seepage, with only three methane seeps recognized seaward of the shelf break. However, massive upper-slope seepage related to gas hydrate degradation has been predicted for the southern part of this margin, even though this process has previously only been recognized in the Arctic. Here we use multibeam water-column backscatter data that cover 94,000 km2 of sea floor to identify about 570 gas plumes at water depths between 50 and 1,700 m between Cape Hatteras and Georges Bank on the northern US Atlantic passive margin. About 440 seeps originate at water depths that bracket the updip limit for methane hydrate stability. Contemporary upper-slope seepage there may be triggered by ongoing warming of intermediate waters, but authigenic carbonates observed imply that emissions have continued for more than 1,000 years at some seeps. Extrapolating the upper-slope seep density on this margin to the global passive margin system, we suggest that tens of thousands of seeps could be discoverable.USGS water resources home page for New Mexico with links to hydrologic studies and real-time and long-term data on streamflow, ground and surface water, and water quality plus map of basins.WMSThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

These types of data, referred to as the general canvass landings statistics, have been collected by the NOAA Fisheries Service, National Marine Fisheries Service and its predecessor agency, the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries. The data are available on computer since the early 1960's. The quantities and values that are reported in this data set include the annual landings that were initiated in 1962. Beginning in 1976, the data were collected monthly. See the sections on Links for the reference to the monthly general canvass landings. The annual general canvass landings include quantities and value for all living marine species and are identified by species (usually the local or common name). These data were collected by field agents employed by the National Marine Fisheries Service or the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries and assigned to local fishing ports. The agents contacted the majority of the seafood dealers or brokers in their assigned areas and recorded the quantities and value for each species or species category from the sales receipts maintained by the seafood dealers. In addition, information on the gear and area of capture is available for most of the landings statistics in the data set. Based on their knowledge of the fishing activity in the area, the agents would estimate the type of fishing gear and area where the fishing was likely to have occurred. More detailed information on the caveats associated with these data is provided in the Characteristics, Caveats and Issues section. However, because these data are summaries, they do not contain information on the quantities of fishing effort or identifications of the fishermen or vessels that caught the fish or shellfish.Orthophotos combine the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map. This tile is provided as a digital ortho quarter-quarter-quadrangle (DOQQQ) 1-foot ground resolution, image cast on the State Plane South coordinate system on the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83).

The only comprehensive sources of regional- and national-scale geologic maps are state geologic maps with scales ranging from 1:100,000 to 1:1,000,000. Digital versions of these state maps form the core of what is presented here. Because no adequate geologic map exists for the state of Alaska, it is being compiled in regional blocks that also form part of this national database. It is expected that this series will completed by approximately the end of 2007. These maps and databases are being released in blocks of states or, in the case of Alaska, as compiled blocks of 1:250,000-scale quadrangles as chapters in this series. For Alaska, formal maps as well as databases are being published here, whereas for the conterminous U.S. only state databases and preview graphics are presented, because published maps for most states already exist. For Alaska these regional compilations will form the base for compiling a new geologic map of the state. As documented in Chapter A, standards for the conterminous U.S. are somewhat different than those for Alaska and Hawaii.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

Due to the large file size of the 1m St. John grid, it was divided into four component grids for improved manageability, named stj04_1_1rug, stj04_1_2rug, stj04_1_3rug, and stj04_1_4rug from west to east.NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Team and NOAA/NOS/OCS/HSD personnel, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory, federal, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data in the US Virgin Islands from 2/18/04 to 3/5/04. Data was acquired with a pole-mounted Reson 8101 ER multibeam echosounder (240 kHz) and processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS v5.4 software. Data has all correctors applied (attitude, sound velocity) and has been reduced to mean lower low water (MLLW) using final approved tides from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM zone 20 north, datum WGS84. The processed CARIS data was used to generate a CARIS BASE surface based on swath angle with footprint size 3*3. An ASCII XYZ file was exported from the BASE surface and opened in ESRI ArcMap 9 as an XY event. Then the ArcToolbox conversion tool 'Feature to Raster' was used to generate an ESRI Grid of bathymetry. Finally, the Slope calculator within ArcGIS Spatial Analyst/Surface Analysis was used to calculate slope in degrees, using that ESRI Grid of source bathymetry.While the project was conducted to meet IHO Order 2 accuracy standards, there is a roll artifact (averaging 0.5m high) in the dataset that the user should take into consideration when performing any analysis.WMSThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

The enhanced (E-50) product suite was launched on September 30, 2009. Its counterpart, the operational product suite, was implemented initially in 2000. Both product suites provide updated monitoring information twice-weekly. This metadata file provides information on the E-50 SST product for both the most recent near-real-time updates and the archived E-50 SST product, dating back to October 2007, when the E-50 SST product first became available. The E-50 SST product provides one major improvement over the current operational 50-km SST product: full coastal coverage. The E-50 SST product produces SST data for areas closer to the coast globally. This is achieved through the use of a higher-resolution land mask and retrieval of satellite data in coastal regions excluded from analysis by the operational land mask. Availability of satellite data for coastal areas greatly improves monitoring of coral reef ecosystems, the majority of which occur along coasts. While the current operational SST product enables direct monitoring of only 40% of the world's coral reefs, this E-50 SST product uses the new 50-km land mask to provide SST monitoring for more than 99% of 50-km pixels that contain coral reefs globally. The E-50 SST product is derived from near-real-time satellite data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) on some of NOAA's Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites (POES), as with the operational SST. CRW's entire experimental enhanced 50-km satellite coral bleaching thermal stress monitoring product suite is based on this enhanced AVHRR SST product. Related details, as well as other important information, are provided on the E-50 portion of the CRW web site: http://coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/satellite/e50/index.php. The E-50 SST product is available in static image and Google Earth formats.

These baseline data were collected to inform planning efforts being undertaken by Virginia CZM to help develop a Virginia Ocean Plan, to help Virginia CZM and the Accomack-Northampton Planning District Commission (A-NPDC) to continue development of the Seaside Special Area Management Plan, and to be incorporated into a regional recreational ocean use dataset that will eventually be displayed on the MARCO data portal. Collecting data on the variety of ways the public uses the Seaside Bays and Atlantic Ocean will help to plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters, maximizing efficiency, and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. State and federally managed waters of Virginia and the U.S. are used in many ways: commercial fishing, aquaculture, shipping, military exercises, sand mining, habitat for wildlife, and recreation. With new and expanding coastal and ocean uses emerging such as energy production and increased shipping and considering Virginias coastal population is increasing (from 3.6 million in 1986 to 5.1 million in 2010), the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data existed, but prior to this project, Virginia had no recreational water use data for its Atlantic coast and Seaside Eastern Shore Bays. This data was colected using the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Marine Protected Areas (MPA) Center Participatory Mapping Method: http://marineprotectedareas.noaa.gov/dataanalysis/mapping_ocean_uses/welcome.htmlThis data is available to view on the Virginia CZM Program's online mapping portal, Coastal GEMS, at www.coastalgems.orgData from Coral Reef Ecosystem Division (CRED), NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC) Subsurface Temperature Recorders (STR) provide a time series of water temperature at coral reef sites. Data is typically collected at 1800 second intervals for a duration of 2 years using a SBE39 Temperature Recorder (Sea-Bird Electronics, Inc., www.seabird.com). When a STR is recovered, a new one is typically deployed in the same place. Time series data combining multiple deployments from a given site may also be available.

NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Branch, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Ron Brown, as well as federal, university, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data off the Atlantic Coast of Florida from the Lost Coast Explorer on 10/28/2010 to 10/31/2010. Data was acquired with a hull-mounted Kongsberg EM 710 multibeam echosounder (70 kHz). It was processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS software. Attitude and sound velocity correctors applied to the data. Verified tides were not applied to the data, leaving the depth values referenced to the ellipsoid. The imagery is projected in the UTM Zone 17 north, NAD83 datum. The processed CARIS data was used to generate a CARIS BASE surface based on swath angle. The CARIS Export option "BASE Surface to Image" was then used to create a GeoTiff of the priority areas. Slope was derived from this surface using the slope calculator, a function of ESRI's Spatial Analyst extension.Department of Economics - University of OxfordNGDC's U.S. Coastal Relief Model (CRM) provides the first comprehensive view of the U.S. coastal zone integrating offshore bathymetry with land topography into a seamless representation of the coast. The CRM spans the U.S. East and West Coasts, the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico, Puerto Rico, and Hawaii, reaching out to, and in places even beyond, the continental slope. Bathymetric and topographic data sources include: NGDC's NOS hydrographic surveys, multibeam bathymetry, and trackline bathymetry; the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS); and other federal government agencies and academic institutions. Bathymetric contours from the International Bathymetric Chart of the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico project were also used. Digital elevation models (DEMs) of the Great Lakes, Southern Alaska, and high-resolution DEMs of U.S. coastal communities and territories are also available.This dataset contains a GeoTIFF with 2x2 meter cell size representing the bathymetry of a sharply sloping swath of the St. John Shelf, a selected portion of seafloor south of St. John, USVI, derived from data collected from 3/28/2011 to 4/14/2011. NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Branch, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory, federal, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data south of St. Thomas and St. John, USVI, from 3/28/11 to 4/14/2011. Data was acquired with a hull-mounted Kongsberg Simrad EM 1002 multibeam echosounder (95 kHz) for water depths greater than 75 meters, and with a moon pool flange-mounted Reson 7125 multibeam echosounder (dual frequecy, 200/400 kHz) for water depths of up to 75 meters. It was processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS software. Data has all correctors applied (attitude, sound velocity) and has been reduced to mean lower low water (MLLW) using final approved tides and zoning from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM zone 20 north, datum NAD83. The processed CARIS data was used to generate a CARIS BASE surface based on CUBE.

Manheim and C.M. Lane-Bostwick of the U.S. Geological Survey, Woods Hole, MA. The data set consists of tables corresponding the USGS Open-File Report 89-020 "Chemical Composition of Ferromanganese Crusts in the World Oceans: A Review and Comprehensive Database." Data include excerpts from the SIO nodule file, the NGDC marine minerals data base, Japanese sources, a Ph.D. thesis, analyses performed at the Bureau of Mines, and analyses performed at other laboratories under the direction of the USGS. These data are also included on the NOAA and MMS Marine Minerals CD-ROM data set released by NGDC in October of 1992. The USGS crust are also available for download from NGDC's Web server.The TIGER/Line shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. The Address Ranges Relationship File (ADDR.dbf) contains the attributes of each address range. Each address range applies to a single edge and has a unique address range identifier (ARID) value. The edge to which an address range applies can be determined by linking the address range to the All Lines Shapefile (EDGES.shp) using the permanent topological edge identifier (TLID) attribute. Multiple address ranges can apply to the same edge since an edge can have multiple address ranges. Note that the most inclusive address range associated with each side of a street edge already appears in the All Lines Shapefile (EDGES.shp). The TIGER/Line Shapefiles contain potential address ranges, not individual addresses. The term "address range" refers to the collection of all possible structure numbers from the first structure number to the last structure number and all numbers of a specified parity in between along an edge side relative to the direction in which the edge is coded. The address ranges in the TIGER/Line Shapefiles are potential ranges that include the full range of possible structure numbers even though the actual structures may not exist.The coastal vulnerability index (CVI)provides a preliminary overview, at a National scale, of the relative susceptibility of the Nation's coast to sea-level rise. This initial classification is based upon variables including geomorphology, regional coastal slope, tide range, wave height, relative sea-level rise, and shoreline erosion and accretion rates. The combination of these variables and the association of these variables to each other furnish a broad overview of coastal regions where physical changes are likely to occur due to sea-level rise. To make this coastal vulnerability index data more accessible to the public and other agencies, the USGS created this web service. This web service was created utilizing ESRI ArcServer. Vector layers were collected, organized by the coastal regions of the U.S., U.S. Atlantic, Pacific and Gulf of Mexico Coasts, and symbology made consistent among similar data sets. This service meets open geospatial consortium standards. The geographic information system (GIS) data layers from this web service are cataloged by region for ease of access.USGS Archive for preservation and access for satellite remote sensing data and imagery (Landsat and AVHRR).

Sonar data were collected November 6 to December 15, 2009, in the estuary north from Saugerties to Troy. Data Collection and Processing: The interferometric system used to measure acoustic reflectivity, provided a quantitative measure of reflectivity for every square meter of the survey area. Fugro's system measured and recorded acoustic reflectivity that has a high dynamic range such that the full range of reflectivity's encountered in the estuary environment can be recorded while maintaining a constant gain setting on the system receiver. Reflectivity data from the GeoSwath was used to produce a normalized as well as a classified image of the bottom. Additionally, Fugro provided slope, aspect and hillshade models as additional acoustic parameters. Backscatter data processing was completed with CARIS 7.0. Raw XTF files were created by converting Hypack format (*.HSX) into Triton format (*.XTF) using Hypack 2009a.Twelve quadrats were sampled along 2 consecutively-placed, 25m transect lines as part of Rapid Ecological Assessments conducted at 14 sites at Pearl and Hermes Atoll in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands in September 2004 from the NOAA vessel Hi`ialakai (HI04-01).

Applied Signal Technology (AST) has combined their SAS with the MacArtney FOCUS-2 ROTV to create the ultimate towed acoustic imaging device, PROSAS Surveyor. Capable of an area coverage rate of 2.5 kilometer/hour with a resolution of 3 centimeters, PROSAS Surveyor will greatly expand capabilities to locate even the oldest archaeological sites on the continental shelf, particularly where sedimentation is limited. Large area seafloor mapping at a resolution capable of imaging very small targets is a tremendously expensive proposition for submerged land managers responsible for bottom lands from 30 to 300 meters in depth. Daily operating costs for a suitable research vessel and personnel limit the area that can be investigated. This project will for the first time apply commercially available SAS technology to the search for historic shipwrecks. The rapidity and resolution of this project's survey will be as much as a four-fold increase in area covered as compared to conventional marine archaeological remote sensing survey.Twelve quadrats were sampled along 2 consecutively-placed, 25m transect lines as part of Rapid Ecological Assessments conducted at 6 sites at Rota in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in August and September, 2003 from the NOAA vessel Oscar Elton Sette (OES03-07).

It is a framework that summarizes U.S. National observations of surface temperature and precipitation data by placing the data into historical perspective. The U.S. National Overview provides access to monthly, 3-month/seasonal, 6-month, 12-month and annual climate summaries by state, division and region. Topics include: Surface Temperature (rankings maps and time series), Precipitation (rankings maps and time series), Percent Area wet/dry cold/warm, and Primary Crop Region Maps with Season-to-Date Precipitation Time series. Additional information on current seasonal summaries for snow, fire, severe weather, and Atlantic and Pacific hurricanes, is also provided.NOAA CoastWatch provides sea surface temperature (SST) products derived from NOAA's Polar Operational Environmental Satellites (POES). This data is provided at high resolution (0.0125 degrees) for the North Pacific Ocean. Measurements are gathered by the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) instrument, a multiband radiance sensor carried aboard the NOAA POES satellites.This project is a cooperative effort between the National Ocean Service, National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science, Center for Coastal Monitoring and Assessment, the University of Hawaii, and Analytical Laboratories of Hawaii, LLC. The goal of the work was to develop coral reef mapping methods and compare benthic habitat maps generated by photointerpreting georeferenced color aerial photography, hyperspectral and IKONOS satellite imagery. The enhanced spectral resolution of hyperspectral and control of bandwidths of multispectral data yield an advantage over color aerial photography particularly when coral health and time series analysis of coral reef community structure are of interest. Depending on the type of instrument, a spectral imaging system can be utilized to see multiple colors from ultraviolet through the far infrared range. The AURORA hyperspectral imaging system collected 72 ten nm bands in the visible and near infrared spectral range with a 3 meter pixel resolution. The data was processed to select band widths, which optimized feature detection in shallow and deep water. Photointerpreters can accurately and reliably delineate boundaries of features in the imagery as they appear on the computer monitor using a software interface such as the Habitat Digitizer.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

Among the twenty channels in the HIRS instrument, channel 12 measures upper tropospheric water vapor (UTWV). Multiple polar orbiting satellites in the NOAA Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite (POES) series and MetOp-A have carried HIRS instruments. Due to the independence in calibration of the individual HIRS instruments, biases exist between satellites. Examination of the intersatellite biases shows that the biases are scene brightness temperature dependent. These HIRS channel 12 measurements from the NOAA POES and MetOp-A are calibrated to a baseline satellite based on intersatellite bias correction data.

After this period, the floats move to a profiling pressure (usually between 1000 and 2000 dbar) then rise, collecting profiles of pressure, temperature, and salinity data on their way to the surface. Once at the surface, the floats remain there for under a day, transmitting the data collected by satellite back to NOAA/PMEL and allowing the satellite to determine their surface drift. They then sink again and repeat their mission. The floats have a nominal lifetime of five years, and will yield valuable information about large-scale ocean water property distributions and currents, including their variability over time scales from seasonal to the duration of the array.

Despite a growing body of LiDAR literature, gaps in information on issues related to acquisition and processing of LiDAR data still exist (Gatziolis and Andersen, 2008, Evans et al. 2009). In recent years, various efforts have been made, at state level and beyond, for web-based distribution of raw LiDAR data (e.g. OpenTopography, CLICK) as well as LiDAR-derived products (e.g. INSIDE Idaho). However, proper processing of raw data, and documenting the processing steps in a standard-compliant metadata are essential before LiDAR data and value-added products can be made available to the public domain through data portals. This data provides a demonstration of a LiDAR workflow for NSF Idaho EPSCoR project Water Resources in a Changing Climate. This is collection level metadata for LAS files collected by USDA - Forest Service as a part of a larger project to use LiDAR for forestry application. The lidar survey was conducted by vendor Spenser B. Gross, 13545 NW Science Park dr.,97229, Portland, OR. Lidar instrument Leica ALS40 was flown over the period of 13 and 26 July 2002. The primary goal of the study is to provide operational implementation of LiDAR technology in support of project level planning. The proposed applications of LiDAR in support of planning are: vegetation structural modeling, erosion modeling, fuels, transportation planning, timber system planning, wildlife habitat modeling, and stream quality. The Rocky Mountain Research Station will provide the development of peer-reviewed forest structural metrics and technical support in implementation of LiDAR technology. The technical specifications have been defined to specifically support vegetation modeling using LiDAR data. The project area consists of four blocks totaling 13350 hectares in Nez Perce Reservation, which is located in central Idaho and is a land of beautiful rivers and steep mountains.

This DSS was initially implemented in 2000 and continues to provide updated monitoring information to the U.S. and international coral reef communities. The first version of the LSD product was launched on October 1, 2009 for the Caribbean region only. It was a pilot project based on preliminary research results on combined stress conducive to coral bleaching from both anomalously high light intensity (insolation) and temperature experienced by coral. Although web-based, the first version of the LSD product was password-protected and available only to project collaborators, for the period April 2009 to the present. The second, public version of the LSD product was released October 31, 2012 on the CRW web site. This metadata file provides information on the second version of the LSD product for both the most recent near-real-time updates and the archived product dating back to October 1, 2012. The experimental LSD product provides a measure of the combined light and thermal stress on the coral photo-system. As currently designed, the LSD product will provide a relative measure of these effects via an index. This index has values that are usually in the range of 0 to 5, but can be greater than 5 if accumulated thermal stress is excessive. Generally speaking, a value of 0 indicates that there is no accumulation of damaging stress, a value of around 1 indicates that stress has accumulated to significant levels and bleaching is expected to begin, and values of 2 or more indicate escalating severity of stress and associated bleaching. Severe bleaching and significant mortality are expected at or beyond an LSD value of 5. The LSD product is updated daily and presently has a resolution of 0.1 degrees. This will be increased to 0.05 degree resolution in the future. Temperature data used in deriving the LSD are the daily NOAA/NESDIS 0.1 degree resolution Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES)-Polar Operational Environmental Satellite (POES) blended SST product. The LSD is also produced using photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) derived from the NESDIS/STAR GOES Surface and Insolation product suite. Hourly PAR data from this product suite are summed to derive a daily total PAR. The daily PAR totals are then used to derive an anomaly product that measures acclimation of the corals to changing light levels from day to day.

Due to the large file size of the 1m St. John grid, it was divided into four component grids for improved manageability, named stj04_1_1rug, stj04_1_2rug, stj04_1_3rug, and stj04_1_4rug from west to east. Rugosity is defined as the ratio of surface area to planar area and is used as a measure of benthic terrain complexity or "roughness". Rugosity values near 1 represent flat, smooth terrain, while higher values reflect increasing rugosity or terrain roughness. For rugosity grid interpretation, is is recommended that the grid be reclassified according to standard deviation divisions.NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Team and NOAA/NOS/OCS/HSD personnel, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory, federal, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data in the US Virgin Islands from 2/18/04 to 3/5/04. Data was acquired with a pole-mounted Reson 8101 ER multibeam echosounder (240 kHz) and processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS v5.4 software. Data has all correctors applied (attitude, sound velocity) and has been reduced to mean lower low water (MLLW) using final approved tides from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM zone 20 north, datum WGS84. The processed CARIS data was used to generate a CARIS BASE surface based on swath angle with footprint size 3*3. An ASCII XYZ file was exported from the BASE surface and opened in ESRI ArcMap 9 as an XY event. Then the ArcToolbox conversion tool 'Feature to Raster' was used to generate an ESRI Grid of bathymetry. The Benthic Terrain Modeller (BTM) tool, a collection of ArcGIS terrain visualization tools developed by the Oregon State University (OSU) Department of Geosciences and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Coastal Services Center, was used to calculate the rugosity of that bathymetric grid. More information on the specific algorithms used can be found in the BTM's documentation.While the project was conducted to meet IHO Order 2 accuracy standards, there is a roll artifact (averaging 0.5m high) in the dataset that the user should take into consideration when performing any analysis.Temperature profile data were collected using moored buoy, profiling floats, and XBT casts in a world wide distribution from 01 September 1999 to 30 November 1999.

Geologic studies include both near-surface deposits and bedrock. Ground water studies include flow systems, aquifer capacity, and ground water chemistry. In some areas sand and gravel deposits, sinkholes, or other features are studied. Interpretation of sensitivity to pollution is also part of an atlas. The information is organized, analyzed, and displayed using geographic information technology. The Scott County Geologic Atlas contains the following plates: Plate 1: Database Map Plate 2: Bedrock Geology Plate 3: Surficial Geology Plate 4: Quaternary Stratigraphy Plate 5: Bedrock Topography, Depth to Bedrock, and Bedrock Geology Models Plate 6: Subsurface Recharge and Surface Infiltration Typically Minnesota Geologic Atlas projects are done in two parts. Part A covers basic geology and creates databases of primary source information such as wells and soil borings. Part B covers hydrogeology and ground water sensitivity. Some ground water sensitivity-related information is covered in Plate 6 of this atlas. There will be no Part B for the Scott County Geologic Atlas.Matplotlib 1.4.3 documentation Search Matplotlib 1.4.3 documentationLandscapes of interwoven wetlands and uplands offer a rich set of ecosystem goods and services.

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. County subdivisions are the primary divisions of counties and their equivalent entities for the reporting of Census Bureau data, and they include legally minor civil divisions (MCDs) and statistical census county divisions (CCDs), and unorganized territories. For the 2010 Census, the legal MCDs are the primary governmental and/or administrative divisions of counties in 29 States and Puerto Rico; Tennessee changed from having CCDs for Census 2000 to having MCDs for the 2010 Census. In MCD States where no MCD exists or is not defined, the Census Bureau creates statistical unorganized territories to complete coverage. The entire area of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas is covered by county subdivisions. The boundaries of all 2010 Census legal MCDs are as of January 1, 2010 as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS). For the 2010 Census, CCDs or their equivalents are delineated in 21 States. The boundaries of all 2010 Census statistical CCDs were delineated as part of the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP).This project was completed under USGS Contract No. 07CRCN0002, Task Order No. 070020009.

The "Larvae Counts Positive Tows" table includes only tows where one or more larvae were captured for the species selected by the user.This dataset contains a unified GeoTiff with 8x8 meter cell size representing the slope (in degrees) of the 2011 biogeographic assessment of the US Virgin Islands, derived from data collected in March 2011. NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Branch, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster, as well as federal, university, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data off of St. Thomas and St. John, USVI from 03/28/2011 to 04/14/2011. Data was acquired with a hull-mounted Kongsberg 1002 multibeam echosounder (95 kHz). It was processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS software. Attitude and sound velocity correctors applied to the data. Verified tides were not applied to the data, leaving the depth values referenced to the ellipsoid. The imagery is projected in the UTM Zone 20 north, NAD83 datum. The processed CARIS data was used to generate a CARIS BASE surface based on swath angle. The CARIS Export option "BASE Surface to Image" was then used to create a GeoTiff of the priority areas. Slope was derived from this surface using the slope calculator, a function of ESRIs Spatial Analyst extension.Fish egg counts and standardized counts for eggs captured in CalCOFI icthyoplankton nets (primarily vertical [Calvet or Pairovet], oblique [bongo or ring nets], and surface tows [Manta nets]). Surface tows are normally standardized to count per 1,000 m3 strained. Oblique tows are normally standardized to count per 10 m2 of surface sampled. This table includes all tows by species, even if zero eggs were captured for the species, i.e., negative tows. The \\\\"Egg Counts Positive Tows\\\\" table includes only tows where one or more eggs were captured for the species selected by the user.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

Information about whether a volcano has been historically active is also provided. Detailed information about each center can be found on the Alaska Volcano Observatory website at http://www.avo.alaska.eduWe assembled 2.1 million National Ocean Service (NOS) bathymetric soundings extending 1,900 km along the Aleutian Islands from Unimak Island in the east to the Russian border in the west, and ranging approximately 500 km north of the central Aleutians to Petrel and Bowers Banks, and also the surrounding deep waters of the southeastern Bering Sea. These bathymetry data are available from the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC: http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov), which archives and distributes data that were originally collected by the NOS and others. While various bathymetry data have been downloaded previously from NGDC, compiled, and used for a variety of projects, our effort differed in that we compared and corrected the digital bathymetry by studying the original analog source documents - digital versions of the original survey maps, called smooth sheets. Our editing included deleting erroneous and superseded values, digitizing missing values, and properly aligning all data sets to a common, modern datum. We also digitized 25,000 verbal surficial sediment descriptions from the smooth sheets, providing the largest single source of sediment information for the Aleutians.The Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) is the system used by the Global Forecast System (GFS) model to place observations into a gridded model space for the purpose of starting, or initializing, weather forecasts with observed data. GDAS adds the following types of observations to a gridded, 3-D, model space: surface observations, balloon data, wind profiler data, aircraft reports, buoy observations, radar observations, and satellite observations. GDAS data are available as both input observations to GDAS and gridded output fields from GDAS. Gridded GDAS output data can be used to start the GFS model. Due to the diverse nature of the assimilated data types, input data are available in a variety of data formats, primarily Binary Universal Form for the Representation of meteorological data (BUFR) and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) binary. The GDAS output is World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Gridded Binary (GRIB).Bayesian Shoreline Change Prediction - A Bayesian network (BN) that was developed to predict long-term shoreline change associated with sea-level rise. The data consist of information compiled as part of the U.S. Geological Survey Coastal Vulnerability Index for the U.S. coastline. In this work, the Bayesian network is used to define relationships between driving forces, geologic constraints, and coastal response which are represented by observations of local rates of relative sea-level rise, wave height, tide range, geomorphic classification, coastal slope, and shoreline change rate. Using this information, the BN is used to make probabilistic predictions of shoreline retreat in response to different future sea-level rise rates.This demonstration server showcases MapServer (www.mapserver.org) and its OGC supportSCAR initiates, develops and coordinates scientific research in the Antarctic region and provides objective independent scientific advice to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings.Provides the ArcGIS Rest Services URLs for the public facing, most current year 1-meter natural color NAIP web services for the lower 48 states, served by USDA-FSA Aerial Photography Field Office.

NDBC has installed approximately 50 C-MAN stations on lighthouses, at capes and beaches, on near shore islands, and on offshore platforms. NDBC has deployed over 100 moored (a.k.a., weather) buoys in coastal and offshore waters from the western Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean around Hawaii, and from the Bering Sea to the South Pacific. C-MAN and moored buoy data typically include barometric pressure, wind direction, speed and gust, and air temperature; however, some C-MAN stations are equipped to also measure seawater temperature, water level, waves, and relative humidity. Moored buoys measure wave energy spectra from which NDBC derives significant wave height, dominant wave period, and average wave period. In addition, many moored buoys measure the direction of wave propagation. In collaboration, NDBC and the National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) are archiving these data from C-MAN and moored buoys. This NODC Accession is part of the collaboration and it contains netCDF (version 4) files with the data collected during July 2011.This map layer contains the shallowest principal aquifers of the conterminous United States, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, portrayed as polygons.

The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is a feature-based database that interconnects and uniquely identifies the stream segments or reaches that make up the nation's surface water drainage system. NHD data was originally developed at 1:100,000-scale and exists at that scale for the whole country. This high-resolution NHD, generally developed at 1:24,000/1:12,000 scale, adds detail to the original 1:100,000-scale NHD. (Data for Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands was developed at high-resolution, not 1:100,000 scale.) Local resolution NHD is being developed where partners and data exist. The NHD contains reach codes for networked features, flow direction, names, and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined on water bodies and the approximate shorelines of the Great Lakes, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. The NHD also incorporates the National Spatial Data Infrastructure framework criteria established by the Federal Geographic Data Committee.This dataset consists of SnowNet Barrow site field campaign data.

This particular dataset is produced by the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSI SAF) in France. The AVHRR is a space-borne scanning sensor on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) family of Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites (POES) having a operational legacy that traces back to the Television Infrared Observation Satellite-N (TIROS-N) launched in 1978. AVHRR instruments measure the radiance of the Earth in 5 (or 6) relatively wide spectral bands. The first two are centered around the red (0.6 micrometer) and near-infrared (0.9 micrometer) regions, the third one is located around 3.5 micrometer, and the last two sample the emitted thermal radiation, around 11 and 12 micrometers, respectively. The legacy 5 band instrument is known as AVHRR/2 while the more recent version, the AVHRR/3 (first carried on the NOAA-15 platform), acquires data in a 6th channel located at 1.6 micrometer. Typically the 11 and 12 micron channels are used to derive sea surface temperature (SST) sometimes in combination with the 3.5 micron channel. The highest ground resolution that can be obtained from the current AVHRR instruments is 1.1 km at nadir. The NOAA platforms are sun synchronous generally viewing the same earth location twice a day (latitude dependent) due to the relatively large AVHRR swath of approximately 2400 km. The NAR products are SST fields derived from direct broadcast High Resolution Picture Transmission (HRPT) AVHRR data that are re-mapped onto a stereopolar grid to produce mosaics at 2 km resolution. An operational AVHRR cloud mask is applied based on a multi-spectral thresholding algorithm (Derrien and Le Gleau 1999). Some refinements specific to the marine conditions have been introduced including the use of fine scale climatology and a fine gradiant climatology to assist in the detection of clouds in areas characterised by strong thermal gradients. L2P data products are then derived following the GHRSST-PP Data Processing Specification (GDS) version 1.5 including Single Sensor Error Statistics (SSES). Although the dataset designation is "L2P" it is actually a "L3C" dataset (gridded Level 3 collated) as defined by the GHRSST Data Processing Specification version 2.0. This dataset was originally produced for the GHRSST Pilot Project (GHRSST-PP), the precursor to GHRSST, by the Medspiration Regional Data Assembly Center (RDAC) in Europe. As one of the first datasets produced as a prototype for the GHRSST-PP it assumed an incorrect designation of "L2P".Educational volcano site providing answers to frequently asked volcano questions with links to other general information on volcanoes and to information on specific volcanoes including the Cascade Range volcanoes.Scientific description of the likely effects of a significant earthquake on this densely populated area.These British Geological Survey (BGS) marine sampling surveys took place from May 2000 to June 2001 in the Mersey estuary. The purpose was to obtain the data necessary for a study of the estuarine geochemistry of the Mersey estuary. Sampling was undertaken using Environment Agency vessels; the hovercraft Sea Spray was used May-July and September/October 2000 and May/June 2001; Sea Jet was used 15/16 February 2001 and RV Coastal Guardian, 8/9 February 2001. Seabed samples were obtained using a Day grab; Mackereth corer and manual beach surface sampling and hand coring. Technical details of the survey are contained in BGS report RR/10/002.A one 1000 ml (one Liter) water sample was collected every 20 days at 2 hour and 4 minute intervals for 2 complete tidal cycles (26 hours) with an ISCO automated water sampler at a depth of 0.5 meters below the water's surface. The water samples were brought into the lab and analyzed for salinity, chlorophyll a, nitrogen (total whole and dissolved, ammonia, and nitrate-nitrite), phosphorus (total and dissolved and ortho phosphate), dissolved organic carbon, suspended sediment (total suspended sediment, inorganic suspended sediment, organic suspended sediment), and suspended sediment color. Tide stage based on published NOAA tide charts for each sample were also included in the database. Samples were simultaneously collected from three of the four sample sites. Three sites are located in salt marsh tidal creeks found in the North Inlet Estuary. These samples are taken at the end of Oyster Landing dock (OL) in Crab Haul Creek, the upper reaches of Debidue Creek (DC) near the boundary between Hobcaw Barony and the Debordieu Colony, and Clambank Landing Dock (CB) in Clambank Creek. The other site is located adjacent to the Winyah Bay Estuary. The Thousand Acre (TA) samples are taken near the mouth of a small tidal creek that connects the Thousand Acre Rice Field to Winyah Bay. For more information on the sample sites, see the Description of Geographic Extent Section.WMSThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

This initial classification is based upon variables including geomorphology, regional coastal slope, tide range, wave height, relative sea-level rise, and shoreline erosion and accretion rates. The combination of these variables and the association of these variables to each other furnish a broad overview of coastal regions where physical changes are likely to occur due to sea-level rise. To make this coastal vulnerability index data more accessible to the public and other agencies, the USGS created this web service. This web service was created utilizing ESRI ArcServer. Vector layers were collected, organized by the coastal regions of the U.S., U.S. Atlantic, Pacific and Gulf of Mexico Coasts, and symbology made consistent among similar data sets. This service meets open geospatial consortium standards. The geographic information system (GIS) data layers from this web service are cataloged by region for ease of access.Consistent, historic, and up-to-date ground-water data, such as water levels collected at wells and springs, are available from the USGS National Water Information System as graphs, tables, or files to download.WMSThis data set contains the locations of volcanos in Cook Inlet and Kenai Peninsula, Alaska.

The National Map Gazetteer contains information about physical and cultural geographic features, geographic areas, and locational entities that are generally recognizable and locatable by name (have achieved some landmark status) and are of interest to any level of government or to the public for any purpose that would lead to the representation of the feature in printed or electronic maps and/or geographic information systems. The dataset includes features of all types in the United States, its associated areas, and Antarctica, current and historical, but not including roads and highways. The dataset holds the federally recognized name of each feature and defines the feature location by state, county, USGS topographic map, and geographic coordinates. Other attributes include names or spellings other than the official name, feature classification, and historical and descriptive information. The dataset assigns a unique, permanent feature identifier, the Feature ID, as a standard Federal key for accessing, integrating, or reconciling feature data from multiple data sets. This dataset is a flat model, establishing no relationships between features, such as hierarchical, spatial, jurisdictional, organizational, administrative, or in any other manner. As an integral part of The National Map, the Gazetteer collects data from a broad program of partnerships with federal, state, and local government agencies and other authorized contributors. The Gazetteer provides data to all levels of government and to the public, as well as to numerous applications through a web query site, web map, feature and XML services, file download services, and customized files upon request.

Data set contains 35 individual core data sets plus time series 1746-1982 of average calcification rate for 10 of these sites. The Australian Institute of Marine Science began collecting cores from very large massive colonies of Porites on the Great Barrier Reef in the early 1980s. Such cores cannot normally be identified to species. The cores were mounted and sawn to remove slices that were about 6-7mm thick. All slices were X-rayed and skeletal density measured along a central track on each slice using a gamma densitometer. The high density portion of annual density bands in Porites from the Great Barrier Reef appears to form usually between October and March, the Southern Hemisphere summer. Peaks in the density profiles were successively counted backwards from the last (outermost or youngest) peak. Density was assumed to peak in January and the most recent peak was dated from the date of collection of the core. Dates were then assigned to all peaks in the series. Time series of the following skeletal growth parameters were then obtained: 1) Average annual density (g.cm-3) 2) Annual linear extension measured between high density peaks (cm.yr-1) 3) Annual calcification (g.cm-2.yr-1_; the product of annual average density and annual linear extension. These data were obtained from coral cores taken at 35 sites on the Great Barrier Reef. The density profiles do not always display regular, obvious annual peaks and we could not be absolutely sure of the dating for some profiles. We consider there may be errors of + or - 2-3 years in the starting data of some of these series. File AIMS10CoreAvg.txt: Time series of average calcification rate is based on 10 Porites corals for 1746-1982: Jeannie River, Flinders Reef, Brook Island, Britomart Reef, Lodestone Reef, Wheeler Reef, Havannah Island, Hook Island, Sanctuary Reef, and Abraham Reef. 3 series are presented: 1) Annual average values expressed as standardized anomalies; each of the 10 series was converted to standardized anomalies with respect to 1934-1982 mean and sd; resulting series then averaged for 10 corals. 2) Annual average standardized anomales filtered with 5-year gaussian filter. 3) Annual average series converted to original calcification units (g.cm-2.yr-1) filtered with 5-year gaussian filter. Because of potential dating errors the last two series are considered to be most reliable. Lough and Barnes (1997) suggest that ~30% of the variance in the 10-coral calcification series can be explained by variations of annual sea-surface temperature.Earth to Sky: An Innovative Partnership between NASA and National Park ServiceWMSGeologic glossary containing simplified definitions for technical terms used within the USGS/National Park Service website on national parks.WMSThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

Towboard surveys are a good method for obtaining a general description of large reef areas, assessing the status of low-density populations of large-bodied reef fish, large-scale disturbances (e.g., bleaching), general distribution and abundance patterns of macro-invertebrates (e.g., COT, giant clams), and for assessing trends in these populations and metrics. A pair of scuba divers (1 fish and 1 benthic diver) are towed 60 m behind a small survey launch at a speed of 1-2 knots and a depth of approximately 15m. Each survey is 50 min long, covers about 2 km of habitat, and is divided into ten 5-minute survey segments. The fish diver records, to the lowest possible taxon, all large-bodied reef fishes (>50cmTL) seen within 5m either side and 10m in front of the towboard. Length of each individual is estimated to the nearest cm. The fish towboard is also outfitted with a forward-facing digital video camera to record the survey swath. The benthic diver records percent cover of coral and macroalgae, estimates benthic habitat type and complexity, and censuses a suite of benthic macroinvertebrates including Crown of Thorns sea stars and sea urchins. The benthic towboard is equipped with a downward-facing digital still camera which images the benthos at 15 second intervals. These images are analyzed for percent cover of coral, algae, and other benthic components. Both towboards are equipped with SEABIRD SBE-39 temperature/depth sensors set to record at 5 second intervals. Latitude and longitude of each survey track is recorded at 15 second intervals using a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver onboard the tow boat. A layback algorithm is applied to more accurately map the position of the divers with respect to the reef environment. This algorithm calculates the position of the divers based on the position of the tow boat taking into account the length of the tow rope, the depth of the divers, and the curvature of the survey track. This metadata applies to the benthic characterization observations.The high resolution National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is a feature-based database that interconnects and uniquely identifies the stream segments or reaches that make up the nation's surface water drainage system. The original medium-resolution NHD (scale 1:100,000) was created by merging the USGS 1:100,000 DLG linework with the USEPA RF3 (Reach File 3) attribution. High resolution NHD (scale: 1:24,000) adds more accurate and detailed stream and lake information to the original 1:100,000-scale NHD. High resolution NHD contains reach codes for networked features and isolated lakes, flow direction, names, stream level, and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined to represent waterbodies (lakes) and the approximate shoreline of Lake Superior. USGS is working in cooperation with several agencies to create high-resolution NHD data for all major watersheds in Minnesota, using the DNR 1:24,000 streams and lakes linework as the base. These agencies include the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, the Land Management Information Center, the Spatial Analysis Research Center at St. Cloud State University, and the U. S. Forest Services Offices in the Chippewa and Superior National Forests.These images are part of a project funded by NOAA Coastal Services Center to develop a high quality, user-friendly, attributed, centralized, multi-territorial digital database of georeferenced historic aerial imagery in the Pacific Islands region, including Hawaii, American Samoa, Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.

Towboard surveys) are conducted by the Coral Reef Ecosystem Division (CRED) of the NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC) as part of biennial Pacific Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program (RAMP) Cruises. These cruises support NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program (CRCP) long-term goals for sustainable management and conservation of coral reef ecosystems. 8 towboard surveys (16.5529 km in length), were conducted at Oahu Island in the Main Hawaiian Islands from 16 October - 14 November 2008 as part of RAMP Cruise OES0810. Towboard surveys are a good method for obtaining a general description of large reef areas, assessing the status of low-density populations of large-bodied reef fish, large-scale disturbances (e.g., bleaching), general distribution and abundance patterns of macro-invertebrates (e.g., COT, giant clams), and for assessing trends in these populations and metrics. A pair of scuba divers (1 fish and 1 benthic diver) are towed 60 m behind a small survey launch at a speed of 1-2 knots and a depth of approximately 15m. Each survey is 50 min long, covers about 2 km of habitat, and is divided into ten 5-minute survey segments. The fish diver records, to the lowest possible taxon, all large-bodied reef fishes (>50cmTL) seen within 5m either side and 10m in front of the towboard. Length of each individual is estimated to the nearest cm. The fish towboard is also outfitted with a forward-facing digital video camera to record the survey swath. The benthic diver records percent cover of coral and macroalgae, estimates benthic habitat type and complexity, and censuses a suite of benthic macroinvertebrates including Crown of Thorns sea stars and sea urchins. The benthic towboard is equipped with a downward-facing digital still camera which images the benthos at 15 second intervals. These images are analyzed for percent cover of coral, algae, and other benthic components. Both towboards are equipped with SEABIRD SBE-39 temperature/depth sensors set to record at 5 second intervals. Latitude and longitude of each survey track is recorded at 15 second intervals using a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver onboard the tow boat. A layback algorithm is applied to more accurately map the position of the divers with respect to the reef environment. This algorithm calculates the position of the divers based on the position of the tow boat taking into account the length of the tow rope, the depth of the divers, and the curvature of the survey track.

The survey area is an 90 square kilometer box located 40 km northeast of Kalispell, Montana This area was flown on May 29, 2005 and completed on May 30, 2005. Lidar data from the Nyack Floodplain on the Middle Fork of the Flathead River was collected for several purposes. The first was to provide a base image from which we could place a network of groundwater wells. The data was also used combination with optical remotes sensing data, both airborne and satellite, to identify pixels within multispectral optical imagery that corresponded to various vegetation height elevations. Those pixels were then separately classified by vegetation type. Data was also used to conduct simple flood inundation modeling of the floodplain and in combination with measures of flow depth and velocity extracting water surface elevation from the lidar to map the spatial distribution of stream power. This area has a repeat survey from Spetember 2005: Flathead Lake Biological Station, MT (September 2005).Map of Mesilla Valley showing channel of the Rio Grande River previous to 1844. Scale 1 inch - 1 mile.NOAA's National Climatic Data Center is now producing the Regional Snowfall Index (RSI) for significant snowstorms that impact the eastern two thirds of the U.S. The RSI ranks snowstorm impacts on a scale from 1 to 5, similar to the Fujita scale for tornadoes or the Saffir-Simpson scale for hurricanes. NCDC has analyzed and assigned RSI values to over 500 storms going as far back as 1900. New storms are added operationally. As such, RSI puts the regional impacts of snowstorms into a century-scale historical perspective. The RSI differs from other indices because it includes population. RSI is based on the spatial extent of the storm, the amount of snowfall, and the juxtaposition of these elements with population. The area and population are cumulative values above regional specific thresholds. For example, the thresholds for the Southeast are 2", 5", 10", and 15" of snowfall while the thresholds for the Northeast are 4", 10", 20", and 30" of snowfall. Population information ties the index to societal impacts. Currently, the index uses population based on the 2000 Census. The RSI is an evolution of the Northeast Snowfall Impact Scale (NESIS) which NCDC began producing operationally in 2005. While NESIS was developed for storms that had a major impact in the Northeast, it includes the impact of snow on other regions as well. It can be thought of as a quasi-national index that is calibrated to Northeast snowstorms. By contrast, the RSI is a regional index; a separate index is produced for each of the six NCDC climate regions in the eastern two-thirds of the nation. The indices are calculated in a similar fashion to NESIS, but our experience has led us to propose a change in the methodology. The new indices require region-specific parameters and thresholds for the calculations. For details on how RSI is calculated, see Squires et al. 2011.Geologic evidence, combined with geographical data and analyized through a geographic information system allows us to compare production statistics with likely resource estimates.A wide variety of web interfaces providing scientific information in geographic form for exploration and analysis, developed by this organization that focuses on geospatial analysis.This set expands the topics included in Set 1 and includes (in addition to landslides) rockfalls, rock avalanches, mud flows, debris flows, slumps, creep, and sinkholes.

This layer was constructed using the following layers: 1. Development Potential The National Guidance suggested using the "Forests on the Edge" data developed by Dr. David Theobold, Colorado State University. These data use the SERGoM v3 model, described in the research paper Watersheds at Risk to Increased Impervious Surface Cover in the Conterminous United States, to predict housing density in ten-year increments from 2000 to 2030. By subtracting 2000 housing densities from 2030 predicted housing densities, we can express the potential areas of new development. The Theobold data broke out housing density into ten classes; we modified these to eight classes as follows: 1. No Development or >80 acres per unit (rural) 2. 40-80 acres per unit (rural 1) 3. 20-40 acres per unit (rural 1) 4. 10-20 acres per unit (rural 2) 5. 1.7-10 acres per unit (rural 2) 6. 0.6-1.7 acres per unit (exurban/urban) 7. <0.6 acres per unit (exurban/urban) 8. Urban/built up (commercial, industrial, transportation) When considering the movement from one density class to another, we wanted to make some judgment about the relative impact of that change. IDL Staff developed the following matrix showing values from 0 (no change) and 1 (low impact change) to 5 (highest impact change) and classified the data accordingly. The numbers in the colored boxes represent the housing density classes shown above. So, movement from density class 2 (one unit per 40 - 80 acres) in 2000 to density class 4 (10-20 acres per unit) by 2030 is considered a very high impact (value of five), A movement from density class 2 (one unit per 40 - 80 acres) in 2000 to density class 3 (one unit per 20-40) acres in 2030, on the other hand, is considered a high change (value of 4). 2030 No_Dev1 / Rural2 / Rural3 / Rural4 / Urban5 / Urban6 / Urban7 / Urban8 2000 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 No Dev 1 -- 3 4 5 5 5 5 5 Rural 2 -- -- 4 5 5 5 5 5 Rural 3 -- -- -- 4 5 5 5 5 Rural 4 -- -- -- -- 3 4 5 5 Urban 5 -- -- -- -- -- 2 4 5 Urban 6 -- -- -- -- -- -- 4 5 Urban 7 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 3 Urban 8 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Table Key -- = no or negative change 1 = low impact change 2 = low-moderate impact change 3 = moderate impact change 4 = high-moderate impact change 5 = high impact change 2. Recreation Pressure from ORV's We used a model developed by the Idaho Department of Lands that incorporated US Census data for population density, the number of ORV registrations by county, TIGER 2000-based streets dataset, and travel distance preferences from 2002 Recreation Demand Assessment by the Idaho Department of Parks and Recreation. We used the following assumptions in developing the model: o Census population can be used as a surrogate for overall recreation pressure o OHV registration totals by county can be used to estimate motorized recreation pressure o The public road network is how recreation pressure is transmitted and dispersed to forested lands o Recreation pressure comes primarily from urban population centers within and outside the state: 1. Boise/Nampa/Caldwell 2. Twin Falls 3. Pocatello 4. Ogden/Layton, UT 5. Logan, UT 6. Idaho Falls 7. Moscow, ID/Pullman, WA 8. Clarkston, WA/Lewiston, ID 9. Spokane, WA/Coeur d'Alene, ID o Recreation pressure on a forestland can come from multiple population centers and is additive o Recreation pressure decreases as travel time to a recreation destination increases (actually, not an assumption but confirmed by IDPR recreation demand surveys) o All parts of the state are equally desirable recreation destinations and certain destinations (such as resort areas, parks, etc.) do not attract more recreation pressure than others o Recreation activity is defined as that which lasts a day or less; multi-day recreation activities are not considered The result is a map that shows ORV pressure based on a 1 to 3 hour travel time. Those areas closest to urban areas (requiring less time to get to) were scored highest. Data was divided into three classes, scored 1 through 3. More information on this model can be found by reading the Modeling Recreation Pressure on Idaho Forest Lands. Issue Process: The two datasets were added together, and then stratified into 5 classes (low to high risk) using natural breaks in the data.

The purpose of this survey was to determine the quality of sediments in terms of the severity, spatial patterns, and spatial extent of chemical contamination, toxicity, and alterations to benthic infauna. The survey area encompassed the region from Port Gardner Bay north to the US / Canada border, excluding the San Juan Islands. Surficial sediments were tested and analyzed from each of the 100 locations. Data from the chemical analyses indicated that toxicologically significant contamination was restricted in scope to a relatively small portion of the region. The spatial extent of relatively severe contamination varied considerably among chemicals; however, less than 2% of the area was considered contaminated for most substances. Sediments from several sampling locations within Everett Harbor often had the highest chemical concentrations. In addition, samples from some stations in Bellingham Bay and other locations scattered throughout the study area had elevated concentrations of some substances. Data from four kinds of toxicity tests indicated a similar pattern: the degree of toxicity was highest in samples from Everett Harbor followed by those from other locations scattered within the survey region. The spatial extent of significant toxicity ranged from 0% to 5% among the toxicity tests. Wide ranges in several numerical indices of benthic infaunal structure indicated good correspondence with tests of toxicity and the concentrations of numerous chemical substances. That is, there was evidence of altered benthic populations in some areas nearest urban centers. Chemical contamination and toxicity of sediments were less severe in northern Puget Sound than in many other estuarine areas studied in the U.S. by NOAA. Results from similar analyses of samples from the central Puget Sound (sampled in 1998) and southern Puget Sound (sampled in 1999) will be compiled with the data from northern Puget Sound, to provide a broad-scale evaluation and quantitation of the spatial scales and patterns in sediment quality throughout the entire region.The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) collaborated on the creation of eight global land survery (GLS) data collections: GLS1975, GLS1990, GLS2000, GLS2005, GLS2005-Islands (EO-1), GLS2010, GLS2010 Islands (EO-1) and GLSLIMA (Antarctica) . Each of these global data sets was created from the primary Landsat sensor in use at the time for those periods of time: the Multispectral Scanner in the 1970s, the Thematic Mapper (TM) in 1990's, and the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) combined with TM data in 2000, 2005, and 2010. Direct downlink to a ground station was the only way to acquire Landsat 5 TM data, because unlike Landsat 7, the Landsat 5 satellite did not have an onboard solid-state recorder. To obtain Landsat 5 TM imagery for areas outside the United States, the USGS negotiated agreements with ground stations around the globe to downlink and send data to USGS. These agreements made thousands of additional Landsat 5 TM scenes available for GLS consideration. The GLS datasets are scene-based. Other decadal mosaics are available in the Landsat Legacy collections.Current river mechanics research on particle friction angles of fluvial gravels (data files compressed in BenHex, Winzip and Unix) and Grand Canyon Beach evolution (animation requiring Java 1.0) plus digital elevation files (*.hgx and *.zip files).This digital map database represents the general distribution of the geology (bedrock and surficial deposits) in San Mateo County.

This map service represents the density of all tug and towing vessel traffic in 2011 for the US East and West Coast from tug and towing vessels with AIS transponders in 100 meter grid cells. The data are best interpreted using a high to low density scale and does not represent actual vessel counts.A digital elevation model (DEM) of a portion of the eastern Florida coastline, post-Hurricane Jeanne (September 2004 hurricane), was produced from remotely sensed, geographically referenced elevation measurements cooperatively by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Elevation measurements were collected over the area using the Experimental Advanced Airborne Research Lidar (EAARL), a pulsed laser ranging system mounted onboard an aircraft to measure ground elevation, vegetation canopy, and coastal topography. The system uses high-frequency laser beams directed at the Earth's surface through an opening in the bottom of the aircraft's fuselage. The laser system records the time difference between emission of the laser beam and the reception of the reflected laser signal in the aircraft. The plane travels over the target area at approximately 50 meters per second at an elevation of approximately 300 meters, resulting in a laser swath of approximately 240 meters with an average point spacing of 2-3 meters. The EAARL, developed originally by NASA at Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia, measures ground elevation with a vertical resolution of +/-15 centimeters. A sampling rate of 3 kilohertz or higher results in an extremely dense spatial elevation dataset. Over 100 kilometers of coastline can be surveyed easily within a 3- to 4-hour mission. When subsequent elevation maps for an area are analyzed, they provide a useful tool to make management decisions regarding land development.

The imagery in this service is derived from high resolution images that combine the visual attributes of an aerial photograph with the spatial accuracy and geometric characteristics of a map. The resolution is primarily 1-meter, and the source imagery is acquired through partnerships with U.S. Department of Agriculture s Farm Service Agency and other cooperating Federal, State, and local agencies through the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP). One meter resolution imagery means that each pixel in the orthoimage covers one meter on the earth s surface. The USGS_EROS_Ortho_SCALE service also has higher resolution orthoimagery acquired through partnerships with the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, and other State and local cooperating agencies. This data may be viewed at scales of 1:13,500 and larger. The resolution of this higher resolution orthoimagery is commonly 1-foot (0.3048-meter), such that each pixel in the orthoimage represents one foot on the earth s surface. However, this orthoimagery can be an even higher resolution, such as 6-inch (0.1524-meter). The National Map viewer allows free downloads of public domain orthoimagery in JPEG 2000 (jp2) format for the conterminous United States at 1-meter resolution, with many urban areas and other locations at 1-foot (or higher) resolution also in JPEG 2000 (jp2) format.

This information collected will be used to evaluate the utility of an experimental fishing closure on one of the most pristine reefs under US jurisdiction in the tropical Western Atlantic. Data collected during this mission (pre-closure) will provide baseline information necessary to evaluate closure efficacy and assess whether the closure should become permanent.Potential Evapotranspiration (PET): These data represent decadal mean totals of potential evapotranspiration estimates (mm). The file name specifies the decade the raster represents. For example, a file named pet_mean_mm_decadal_MPI_ECHAM5_A1B_annual_2000-2009.tif represents the decade spanning 2000-2009. The data were generated by using the Hamon equation and output from ECHAM5, a fifth generation general circulation model created by the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg Germany. Data are at 2km x 2km resolution, and all data are stored in geotiffs. Calculations were performed using R 2.12.1 and 2.12.2 for Mac OS Leopard, and data were formatted into geotiffs using the raster and rgdal packages. Users are reminded that the PET estimates include the inherent uncertainty of model projections. In addition, the methods used to derive PET from temperature require a number of assumptions, which future conditions may or may not meet. In particular, these methods as implemented assume that cloudcover and relative humidity remain constant. This may or may not be true. Hamon Equation: These data were derived by applying the Hamon equation as outlined in Lu et al. (2005) to monthly average temperature downscaled by SNAP.The W-band Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program Cloud Radar (WACR) systems are zenith pointing Doppler radars that probe the extent and composition of clouds at 95.04 GHz. The main purpose of this radar is to determine cloud boundaries (e.g., cl oud bottoms and tops). This radar reports estimates for the first three spectra moments for each range gate up to 15 km. The 0th moment is reflectivity, the 1st moment is radial velocity, and the 2nd moment is spectral width. Also available are the raw spe ctra files. Unlike the millimeter wavelength cloud radar (MMCR), the WACR does not use pulse coding and operates in only copolarization and cross-polarization modes.National seismic hazards maps, global seismic hazards map, predictive intensity maps, shaking hazards maps and probabilities for California, and a variety of fact sheets on earthquakes.Shows how we can use remote sensing to study natural phenomena that vary seasonally but whose timing is affected by both shorter- and longer-term variations in climate or other, similar environmental conditions.The TIGER/Line Files are shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) that are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Block Groups (BGs) are defined before tabulation block delineation and numbering, but are clusters of blocks within the same census tract that have the same first digit of their 4-digit census block number from the same decennial census. For example, Census 2000 tabulation blocks 3001, 3002, 3003,.., 3999 within Census 2000 tract 1210.02 are also within BG 3 within that census tract. Census 2000 BGs generally contained between 600 and 3,000 people, with an optimum size of 1,500 people. Most BGs were delineated by local participants in the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP). The Census Bureau delineated BGs only where the PSAP participant declined to delineate BGs or where the Census Bureau could not identify any local PSAP participant. A BG usually covers a contiguous area. Each census tract contains at least one BG, and BGs are uniquely numbered within census tract. Within the standard census geographic hierarchy, BGs never cross county or census tract boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of other geographic entities like county subdivisions, places, urban areas, voting districts, congressional districts, and American Indian / Alaska Native / Native Hawaiian areas. BGs have a valid code range of 0 through 9. BGs coded 0 were intended to only include water area, no land area, and they are generally in territorial seas, coastal water, and Great Lakes water areas. For Census 2000, rather than extending a census tract boundary into the Great Lakes or out to the U.S. nautical three-mile limit, the Census Bureau delineated some census tract boundaries along the shoreline or just offshore. The Census Bureau assigned a default census tract number of 0 and BG of 0 to these offshore, water-only areas not included in regularly numbered census tract areas.Layered GeoPDF 7.5 Minute Quadrangle Map.

The database represents sediment variation over the study area with uncompromized (i.e., original) spatial detail. Textural data in the database are of two main types: 1) standardized statistics characterizing sample grain size distribution based on laboratory measurements (granulometric data), including percent composition by size grades (e.g., gravel, sand, mud) and size distribution parameters (e.g., mean size); and 2) sample descriptions from less exacting, more subjective visual/tactile observations, usually made in the field, establishing size-grade constituents. In addition the EBSSED database includes two descriptive fields which were each added to characterize sample grain size distribution by a single, standardized variable based on the original data. These fields classify samples according to gravel-sand-mud composition using high and low resolution schemes derived from Folk's (1954) classic ternary diagram. The high resolution scheme classifies 903 samples with detailed granulometric data into 15 textural classes, providing the greater detail regarding textural variation. The low resolution scheme (7 classes) is designed to allow unambiguous classification of nearly all samples (n=2457) including those with subjective visual/tactile descriptions. It represents the maximum number of samples according to a single common variable and thus provides the most spatially detailed data for the study area, albeit at the expense of some of the textural detail for samples analyzed in the laboratory. Overall, the EBSSED database is the most comprehensive and detailed source of information about surficial sediment textures in the EBS study area. Patterns observed in the data generally agree with large-scale textural maps and summaries by previous investigators, particularly a general pattern, with exceptions, of decreasing average grain size with increasing depth and distance from shore. However, those previous large-scale works spatially smoothed data for the study area from smaller, more sparsely distributed sets of samples. The EBSSED database preserves potentially important fine-scale variation.WMSLook up information on HTML, CSS, SVG, XPath from the W3C Cheatsheet.Residential Life, ResLifeThe All Roads Shapefile includes all features within the MTDB Super Class "Road/Path Features" distinguished where the MAF/TIGER Feature Classification Code (MTFCC) for the feature in MTDB that begins with "S".

These sites encompass land which is federally owned or otherwise managed. This dataset was created from source data provided by the four Military Service Component headquarters and was compiled by the Defense Installation Spatial Data Infrastructure (DISDI) Program within the Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Installations and Environment, Business Enterprise Integration Directorate. Sites were selected from the 2010 Base Structure Report (BSR), a summary of the DoD Real Property Inventory. This list does not necessarily represent a comprehensive collection of all Department of Defense facilities, and only those in the fifty United States and US Territories were considered for inclusion. For inventory purposes, installations are comprised of sites, where a site is defined as a specific geographic location of federally owned or managed land and is assigned to military installation. DoD installations are commonly referred to as a base, camp, post, station, yard, center, homeport facility for any ship, or other activity under the jurisdiction, custody, control of the DoD.This dataset is a record of fish distribution and activity for BROOK TROUT contained in the StreamNet database.

The system operates from a deHavilland DHC-6 Twin Otter flying at altitudes between 200 and 400 meters with a ground speed of about 100 knots. The SHOALS system also includes a ground-based data processing system for calculating acurate horizontal position and water depth. Lidar is an acronym for LIght Detection And Ranging. The system operates by emitting a pulse of light that travels from an airborne platform to the water surface where a small portion of the laser energy is backscattered to the airborne receiver. The remaining energy at the water's surface propogates through the water column and reflects off the sea bottom and back to the airborne detector. The time difference between the surface return and the bottom return corresponds to water depth. The maximum depth the system is able to sense is related to the complex interaction of radiance of bottom material, incident sun angle and intensity, and the type and quantity of organics or sediments in the water column. As a rule-of-thumb, the SHOALS system should be capable of sensing bottom to depths equal to two or three times the Secchi depth.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

The LOF is the annual publication that updates these classifications. NOAA Fisheries has developed and implemented fishery classification criteria, which consists of a two-tiered, stock-specific approach. This two-tiered approach first addresses the total impact of all fisheries on each marine mammal stock and then addresses the impact of individual fisheries on each stock. This approach is based on the rate, in numbers of animals per year, of incidental mortalities and serious injuries of marine mammals due to commercial fishing operations relative to a stock's PBR level. The PBR level is defined (50 CFR 229.2) as the maximum number of animals, not including natural mortalities, that may be removed from a marine mammal stock while allowing that stock to reach or maintain its optimum sustainable population. While Tier 1 considers the cumulative fishery mortality and serious injury for a particular stock, Tier 2 considers fishery-specific mortality for a particular stock. Tier 1: annual mortality and serious injury across all fisheries that interact with a stock: If the total is ?10% of the PBR level of this stock, all fisheries interacting with this stock would be placed in Category III. Otherwise, these fisheries are subject to the next tier (Tier 2) of analysis to determine their classification. Tier 2: Annual mortality and serious injury of a stock in a given fishery is: Category I: ?50% of the PBR level Category II: between 1% and 50% of the PBR level Category III: ?1% of the PBR level Category I & II fisheries are then subject to the Marine Mammal Authorization Program, potential take reduction measures, and must carry an observer when requested by NOAA or its designate.MarineCadastre.gov is a marine information system that provides authoritative ocean data, offshore planning tools, and technical support to the offshore renewable energy community. The project was initiated by the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-58) Sec. 388 Alternative Energy-Related Uses on the Outer Continental Shelf, which directs the secretary of the interior, in cooperation with the secretary of commerce, the commandant of the Coast Guard, and the secretary of defense, to establish an outer continental shelf (OCS) mapping initiative to assist in decision-making related to alternative energy uses on the OCS. At its core, MarineCadastre.gov contains marine cadastral data, which encompass the spatial extent, usage, rights, restrictions, and responsibilities of marine areas, as well as other regionally specific data needed to support planning, management, and conservation of submerged lands and marine spaces. The combination of marine cadastral and regionally specific data provides users with many of the data layers needed for renewable energy siting and other ocean planning efforts. The MarineCadastre.gov National Viewer is intended to be used as a planning and screening tool to inform decisions on ocean uses. It is not intended to be used for precise site selection, but rather to provide the geospatial picture of ocean planning data layers needed to make decisions about where suitable areas exist for offshore activities. MarineCadastre.gov also has more regionally focused viewers within its Map Gallery. Those viewers demonstrate how marine cadastre data can be used along with state or regionally applicable data sets to inform ocean planning decisions.The MarineCadastre.gov Data Registry lists all the data layers that can be found on MarineCadastre.gov with the ability to shop for layers, add these to a cart, and open in a map on ArcGIS Online.

It includes pictures from 1886 to 1988. The set includes nine destructive earthquakes that occurred in the U.S. and eight earthquakes that occurred in foreign countries. These unusual slides show earthquake damage to school s and university buildings around the world. They graphically illustrate the potential danger to our schools, and to the welfare of our children, that results from major earthquakes. The slides range from Algeria, where a collapsed school roof is held up only by students' desks; to Anchorage, Alaska, where an elementary school structure has split in half; to California and other areas, where school buildings have sustained damage to walls, roofs, and chimneys. Interestingly, all the United States earthquakes depicted in this set of slides occurred either on a holiday or before or after school hours, except the 1935 tremor in Helena, Montana, which occurred at 11:35 a.m. It undoubtedly would have caused casualties had the schools not been closed days earlier by Helena city officials because of a damaging foreshock. Students in Algeria, the People's Republic of China, Armenia, and other stricken countries were not so fortunate. This set of slides represents 17 destructive earthquakes that occurred in 9 countries, and covers more than a century--from 1886 to 1988. Two of the tremors, both of which occurred in the United States, were magnitude 8+ on the Richter Scale, and four were magnitude 7-7.9. The events represented by the slides (see table below) claimed more than a quarter of a million lives. List Of Earthquakes represented in the slide set are: Algeria: El Asnam, Armenian SSR: Spitak, Australia: Cadoux, Ecuador: Esmeraldas, Mexico: Veracruz, People's Republic of China: Tangshan, Peru: Lima, Turkey: Lice, USA: Alaska: Anchorage, California: San Francisco, Long Beach, Kern County, Coalinga, Montana: Hebgen Lake, Helena, South Carolina: CharlestonIn the following descriptions of earthquakes the location is only approximate.

(NODC Accession 0069096)This Gravity Field Atlas of the Southern Ocean from GEOSAT is MGG Report 7. In many areas of the global ocean, the depth of the seafloor is not well known because survey lines by ships are hundreds of kilometers apart. Satellites carrying radar altimeters have measured the shape of the ocean along tracks only 3-4 km apart, and from these data we can make very accuratore (+/-3mGal) and high resolution (15km) maps of the marine gravity field. The gravity field mimics the seafloor topography in the 15-160 km wavelength band if sediment cover on the ocean floor is thin. Long-wavelength (greater than 160 km) topography is isostatically compensated and is not correlated with the gravity field. In addition, the satellite gravity field and the available depth measurements were used to determine the correlation between gravity and the seafloor topography. By applying this correlation to the gravity field we predict seafloor topography in the 15-160 km wavelength band. This topography is combined with a long-wavelength component estimated directly from ship depth measurements. The result reveals many new features and is within +/- 100m of actual depths in many cases. The Predicted Seafloor Topography derived from the depths estimated from Satellite Altimetry in combination with measured trackline bathymetry is an inferred data set and is not true bathymetry. It is, however, the best estimate of seafloor topography available resulting from satellite gravity data and actual ship depth measurements. These data are intended for scientific research and should not be used for navigational purposes. Additional software is required in order to manipulate the data or produce your own graphic images. Poster and CD-ROM products are available for both gravity anomaly and estimated seafloor topography of several regions.

A Legislative district is a political subdivisions into which a state is divided for electing members to the Legislature. Each legislative district is represented by one senator and two representatives. Since Idaho's legislative districts are not further split into two House of Representative districts, both representatives, like the senator, serve the entire district. The districts are established by state law and are redrawn following a decennial census to maintain equal population in each.Chemical, physical, profile and underway oceanographic data were collected aboard the GORDON GUNTER in the Gulf of Mexico from 2010-05-27 to 2010-06-04 in response to the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill event on April 20, 2010, by the Subsurface Monitoring Unit (SMU), which consisted of multiple government and corporate agencies. These data include CDOM fluorescence, conductivity, current speed - east/west component (U), current speed - north/south component (V), dissolved oxygen, hydrostatic pressure, salinity, sound velocity, temperature and water density. The instruments used to collect these data included ADCP, CTD, bathythermograph - XBT, fluorometer and oxygen meter along with other physical sampling devices. More specific information about each data set is located in their individual metadata records. The Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler ADCP used sonar to measure and record water current velocities and the distribution of suspended material over a range of depths. Absolute U- and V-component ocean current vectors from the ADCP collected can be used to create detailed maps of the distribution of water currents and suspended materials through the water column along the ship's path. The data from this ADCP is raw and unprocessed. Some of the datasets associated with this instrument are still incomplete and will be published as they become available. This data set also contains products created for use in real time analysis and decision support. These products may include charts, graphs, maps, plots, and GIS formatted data files. The CTD data underwent preliminary quality assurance and control procedures at the National Coastal Data Development Center (NCDDC).

Historically studied as isolated environments, scientists made discoveries that helped link these deep water communities (or "islands") that lie beneath the Yucatan, Loop and Gulf Stream currents (i.e., the 'stream'). The voyage also helped to document pieces of our maritime heritage and engaged the public through numerous education and outreach events. Islands in the Stream was a three-month scientific expedition to marine protected areas and other habitats being considered for protection from offshore of Belize in Central America to North Carolina's continental shelf. 'Islands' are the coral reefs and hard-bottom (also called 'hard substrate') biological communities found along the course of a massive "stream" of ocean currents connecting the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, and the western Atlantic off North America. This expedition emphasized habitat characterization and an understanding of these islands' 'connection' as parts of an interrelated ecosystem. Though separated by large expanses of ocean water, the fishes, corals, and invertebrates common to these islands demonstrated that the health and vitality of "downstream" islands are linked closely to those located 'upstream.' The expedition was conducted in two major segments: The Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico Expedition (from Belize to the Dry Tortugas at the tip of the Florida Keys) and the South Altantic Bight Expedition (from Oculina Bank Reserve, off Florida's Atlantic Coast, to three sites off the North Carolina continental.Direccion Nacional del Antartico The GCMD database holds more than 25,000 descriptions of Earth science data sets and services covering all aspects of Earth and environmental sciences.The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) collaborated on the creation of eight global land survery (GLS) data collections: GLS1975, GLS1990, GLS2000, GLS2005, GLS2005-Islands (EO-1), GLS2010, GLS2010 Islands (EO-1) and GLSLIMA (Antarctica) . Each of these global data sets was created from the primary Landsat sensor in use at the time for those periods of time: the Multispectral Scanner in the 1970s, the Thematic Mapper (TM) in 1990's, and the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) combined with TM data in 2000, 2005, and 2010. Direct downlink to a ground station was the only way to acquire Landsat 5 TM data, because unlike Landsat 7, the Landsat 5 satellite did not have an onboard solid-state recorder. To obtain Landsat 5 TM imagery for areas outside the United States, the USGS negotiated agreements with ground stations around the globe to downlink and send data to USGS. These agreements made thousands of additional Landsat 5 TM scenes available for GLS consideration. The GLS datasets are scene-based. Other decadal mosaics are available in the Landsat Legacy collections.This dataset includes a reference baseline used by the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) to calculate rate-of-change statistics.

Data set contains 35 individual core data sets plus time series 1746-1982 of average calcification rate for 10 of these sites. The Australian Institute of Marine Science began collecting cores from very large massive colonies of Porites on the Great Barrier Reef in the early 1980s. Such cores cannot normally be identified to species. The cores were mounted and sawn to remove slices that were about 6-7mm thick. All slices were X-rayed and skeletal density measured along a central track on each slice using a gamma densitometer. The high density portion of annual density bands in Porites from the Great Barrier Reef appears to form usually between October and March, the Southern Hemisphere summer. Peaks in the density profiles were successively counted backwards from the last (outermost or youngest) peak. Density was assumed to peak in January and the most recent peak was dated from the date of collection of the core. Dates were then assigned to all peaks in the series. Time series of the following skeletal growth parameters were then obtained: 1) Average annual density (g.cm-3) 2) Annual linear extension measured between high density peaks (cm.yr-1) 3) Annual calcification (g.cm-2.yr-1_; the product of annual average density and annual linear extension. These data were obtained from coral cores taken at 35 sites on the Great Barrier Reef. The density profiles do not always display regular, obvious annual peaks and we could not be absolutely sure of the dating for some profiles. We consider there may be errors of + or - 2-3 years in the starting data of some of these series. File AIMS10CoreAvg.txt: Time series of average calcification rate is based on 10 Porites corals for 1746-1982: Jeannie River, Flinders Reef, Brook Island, Britomart Reef, Lodestone Reef, Wheeler Reef, Havannah Island, Hook Island, Sanctuary Reef, and Abraham Reef. 3 series are presented: 1) Annual average values expressed as standardized anomalies; each of the 10 series was converted to standardized anomalies with respect to 1934-1982 mean and sd; resulting series then averaged for 10 corals. 2) Annual average standardized anomales filtered with 5-year gaussian filter. 3) Annual average series converted to original calcification units (g.cm-2.yr-1) filtered with 5-year gaussian filter. Because of potential dating errors the last two series are considered to be most reliable. Lough and Barnes (1997) suggest that ~30% of the variance in the 10-coral calcification series can be explained by variations of annual sea-surface temperature.Stereoscopic aerial photographs supplied by CUCAP (Cambridge University Centre for Aerial Photography) at scale of 1:10,000, CR World (Liverpool Bay Forum), BKS Surveys Limited, ExeGesIS and the Environment Agency for the coast of Wales.The Core Research Center (CRC) was established in 1974 by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to preserve valuable rock cores for use by scientists and educators from government, industry, and academia.

The vector data file is included in "Contours_OffshoreBolinas.zip," which is accessible from http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/781/OffshoreBolinas/data_catalog_OffshoreBolinas.html. 10-m interval contours of the Offshore of Bolinas map area, California, were generated from bathymetry data collected by California State University, Monterey Bay (CSUMB), by Fugro Pelagos, and by Moss Landing Marine Laboratory (MLML). Mapping was completed between 2004 and 2010, using a combination of 200-kHz and 400-kHz Reson 7125, and 244-kHz Reson 8101 multibeam echosounders, as well as 468-kHz SEA SWATHPlus and 250-kHz GeoSwath interferometric systems. These mapping missions combined to collect bathymetry from about the 10-m isobath to beyond the 3-nautical-mile limit of California s State Waters. Bathymetric contours at 10-m intervals were generated from a modified 10-m bathymetric surface. The most continuous contour segments were preserved while smaller segments and isolated island polygons were excluded from the final output. Contours were smoothed via a polynomial approximation with exponential kernel (PAEK) algorithm using a tolerance value of 60 m. The contours were then clipped to the boundary of the map area. These data are not intended for navigational purposes.The National Elevation Dataset (NED) is a seamless raster product primarily derived from USGS 10- and 30-meter Digital Elevation Models (DEMs).

The goal of the work was to map the coral reef habitats of American Samoa, Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands by visual interpretation and manual delineation of IKONOS satellite imagery.A two tiered habitat classification system was tested and implemented in this work. It integrates geomorphologic reef structure and biological cover into a single scheme and subsets each into detail. It also includes thirteen zones. Benthic features were mapped that covered an area of 45.2 square kilometers of which 4.4 were unconsolidated sediment and 40.9 were coral reef and hard bottom. Of the coral reef and hard bottom class, 59.9% is colonized by greater than 10% coral cover.Underwater archaeologists, led by James Adovasio and Andy Hemmings of Mercyhurst College, dove at four sites that were first visited in 2009. At these locations, electronically documented intact river channel features of the Pleistocene Suwannee River are now filled with multiple layers of sediment. These sites are covered by 40 to 130 feet of ocean water and are located 50 to 125 miles offshore of the modern Gulf Coast of Florida northwest of Tampa or southeast of Tallahassee. The three shallower sites have bedrock exposed on the seafloor that forms one side of the buried channel. The bedrock at each of these sites is low grade knappable toolstone that could have been used for tool making. The deepest site, Thor?s Elbow, is the intersection of the ancient Suwannee and another river where they expected to find more knappable bedrock buried under the modern surface. At each of these sites divers hoped to locate prehistoric human made artifacts, bones of Pleistocene animals, such as the mastodon, and perhaps datable organic material such as pieces of wood. Any such finds would indicate that the now inundated Pleistocene landscape of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico is still preserved, accessible to archaeologists, and contains prehistoric evidence of the use of this landscape by people and animals alive at the end of the last Ice Age.WMSThis part of DS 781 presents data for the acoustic-backscatter map of the Offshore of Tomales Point map area, California. Backscatter data are provided as separate grids depending on mapping system or processing method. The raster data file is included in "BackscatterA_8101_ OffshoreTomalesPoint.zip", which is accessible from http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/781/OffshoreTomalesPoint/data_catalog_OffshoreTomalesPoint.html. The acoustic-backscatter map of the Offshore of Tomales Point map area, California, was generated from backscatter data collected by California State University, Monterey Bay (CSUMB), by Fugro Pelagos, and by the U.S. Geological Survey. Mapping was completed between 2004 and 2010, using a combination of 200-kHz and 400-kHz Reson 7125, and 244-kHz Reson 8101 multibeam echosounders, as well as 234-kHz and 468-kHz SEA SWATHPlus phase-differencing sidescan sonars. These mapping missions combined to collect backscatter data from about the 10-m isobath to beyond the 3-nautical-mile limit of California's State Waters. Within the acoustic-backscatter imagery, brighter tones indicate higher backscatter intensity, and darker tones indicate lower backscatter intensity. The intensity represents a complex interaction between the acoustic pulse and the seafloor, as well as characteristics within the shallow subsurface, providing a general indication of seafloor texture and composition. Backscatter intensity depends on the acoustic source level; the frequency used to image the seafloor; the grazing angle; the composition and character of the seafloor, including grain size, water content, bulk density, and seafloor roughness; and some biological cover. Harder and rougher bottom types such as rocky outcrops or coarse sediment typically return stronger intensities (high backscatter, lighter tones), whereas softer bottom types such as fine sediment return weaker intensities (low backscatter, darker tones). These data are not intended for navigational purposes.UAF Geospatial metadata search.Information concerning status and trends of biological resources, focusing on boreal forest ecosystemspowered by the HUBzero(R) Platform for Scientific CollaborationWMSOnline booklet on natural gemstones, terminology, geologic environment, birthstones, U.S. production, chemical formulas, and references.On November 8, 2011, an extra-tropical cyclone with a low pressure of 945 millibars developed over the Bering Sea and moved northeast across the western coast of Alaska. This large storm brought high winds (gusts of up to 85 mph) to the entire region and a storm surge of approximately 3 to 4 meters to parts of Norton Sound. The storm caused extensive flooding in the lower portion of Golovin on the afternoon of November 9, 2011. A team of Alaska Division of Geological & Geophysical Surveys (DGGS) scientists visited Golovin on November 15, 2011, to document peak water levels, runup elevations, and inundation extents caused by this event. These data were combined with photographs taken by local residents during the event and elevation data from the 2004 DCCED Community Map to generate inundation limit lines.The National Status and Trends (NS) Benthic Surveillance Project Chemistry data file reports the trace concentrations of a suite of chemical contaminants in marine sediment and benthic fish tissue samples collected from all U.S. coastal regions from 1984 to 1992.

It was developed by the National Cooperative Soil Survey and supersedes the State Soil Geographic (STATSGO) data set published in 1994. It consists of a broad based inventory of soils and nonsoil areas that occur in a repeatable pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at the scale mapped. The data set was created by generalizing more detailed soil survey maps. Where more detailed soil survey maps were not available, data on geology, topography, vegetation, and climate were assembled, together with Land Remote Sensing Satellite (LANDSAT) images. Soils of like areas were studied, and the probable classification and extent of the soils were determined. Map unit composition was determined by transecting or sampling areas on the more detailed maps and expanding the data statistically to characterize the whole map unit. This data set consists of georeferenced vector digital data and tabular digital data. The map data were collected in 1-by 2-degree topographic quadrangle units and merged into a seamless national data set. It is distributed in state/territory and national extents. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the National Soil Information System data base which gives the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties.

The Integrated Surface Data (ISD) database is composed of worldwide surface weather observations from over 20,000 stations, collected and stored from sources such as the Automated Weather Network (AWN), the Global Telecommunications System (GTS), the Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS), and data keyed from paper forms. Most digital observations are decoded either at operational centers and forwarded to the Federal Climate Complex (FCC) in Asheville, NC, or decoded at the FCC. The US Air Force Combat Climatology Center (AFCCC), the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC), and the US Navy's Fleet Numerical Meteorological and Oceanographical Command Detachment (FNMOD), make up the FCC in Asheville. Each agency is responsible for data ingest, quality control, and customer support for surface climatological data. All data are now stored in a single ASCII format. Numerous DOD and civilian customers use this database in climatological applications. ISD refers to the digital database and format in which hourly and synoptic (3-hourly) weather observations are stored. The format conforms to Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS). The database includes data originating from various codes such as synoptic, airways, METAR (Meteorological Routine Weather Report), and SMARS (Supplementary Marine Reporting Station), as well as observations from automatic weather stations. The data are sorted by station-year-month-day-hour-minute. Parameters included are: air quality, atmospheric pressure, atmospheric temperature/dew point, atmospheric winds, clouds, precipitation, ocean waves, tides and more. ISD Version 1 was released in 2001, with Version 2 (additional quality control applied) in 2003. Since 2003, there have been continued incremental improvements in automated quality control software.GEOTRACES, An International Study of Marine Biogeochemical Cycles of Trace Elements and their IsotopesWMSWMSThis dataset is a subset of the dataset titled ALL CULTRAL POINTS, created by the Arkansas Highway and Transportation Department.

This geospatial data is derived from the FAA's National Airspace System Resource Aeronautical Data Product (Effective 18 January 2007).The overarching goal of this collaboration was to provide the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary (FGBNMS) staff with information on biogeographic patterns within the Sanctuary. This specific project focused on the development of a plan to spatially and quantitatively characterize the fish communities in relatively shallow waters throughout the Sanctuary (less than 110 ft). This collaboration also included the initial implementation of that plan. The FGBNMS represents the northernmost tropical western Atlantic coral reef on the continental shelf and support the most highly developed offshore hard bank community in the region. The complexity of habitats supports a diverse assemblage of organisms including approximately 250 species of fish, 23 species of coral, and 80 species of algae in addition to large sponge communities. Understanding and monitoring these resources is critical to both sanctuary inventory and management activities. Monitoring of the biological communities has taken place at FGBNMS since the 1970s. This work has focused primarily on monitoring the benthos with video transects and photostations documenting transitions between coral, algae and sponge communities over time. Until relatively recently, little has been done to monitor or characterize the reef fish community. In 1994 the Reef Environmental Education Foundation (REEF) began surveys of the Sanctuary and utilized a combination of REEF personnel, volunteers, and Sanctuary staff to visually census reef fish populations via roving diver surveys. These surveys have been invaluable in terms of species list development and understanding the ranges of these species. Subsequently, a stationary point-count survey technique was utilized to begin to quantify community metrics such as species abundance and trophic structure at selected locations. These data provide an important starting point for characterizing the fish community; however, they are limited in scope of inference to small portions of the Sanctuary coral cap environment and are therefore difficult to utilize in developing population estimates at the scale of the Sanctuary.WMSList of plant specimens and photo gallery of plants in the collection of the herbarium at the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center, a reference collection of plants occurring in the area lying between Baltimore, Maryland and Washington D.C.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

These images were scanned on a flatbed scanner and georeferenced to existing basemap data.This is a full color 24 by 36 inch poster. In many areas of the global ocean, the depth of the seafloor is not well known because survey lines by ships are hundreds of kilometers apart. Satellites carrying radar altimeters have measured the shape of the ocean along tracks only 3-4 km apart, and from these data we can make very accuratore (+/-3mGal) and high resolution (15km) maps of the marine gravity field. The gravity field mimics the seafloor topography in the 15-160 km wavelength band if sediment cover on the ocean floor is thin. Long-wavelength (greater than 160 km) topography is isostatically compensated and is not correlated with the gravity field. In addition, the satellite gravity field and the available depth measurements were used to determine the correlation between gravity and the seafloor topography. By applying this correlation to the gravity field we predict seafloor topography in the 15-160 km wavelength band. This topography is combined with a long-wavelength component estimated directly from ship depth measurements. The result reveals many new features and is within +/- 100m of actual depths in many cases. The Predicted Seafloor Topography derived from the depths estimated from Satellite Altimetry in combination with measured trackline bathymetry is an inferred data set and is not true bathymetry. It is, however, the best estimate of seafloor topography available resulting from satellite gravity data and actual ship depth measurements. These data are intended for scientific research and should not be used for navigational purposes. Additional software is required in order to manipulate the data or produce your own graphic images. Poster and CD-ROM products are available for both gravity anomaly and estimated seafloor topography of several regions.

This literature database is maintained by the NOAA Air Resources Laboratory (NOAA-ARL).This data set contains imagery from the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP). The NAIP acquires digital ortho imagery during the agricultural growing seasons in the continental U.S.. A primary goal of the NAIP program is to enable availability of ortho imagery within one year of acquisition. The NAIP provides two main products: 1 meter ground sample distance (GSD) ortho imagery rectified to a horizontal accuracy within +/- 5 meters of reference digital ortho quarter quads (DOQQ's) from the National Digital Ortho Program (NDOP) or from the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP); 1 meter GSD ortho imagery rectified within +/- 6 meters to true ground. The tiling format of NAIP imagery is based on a 3.75' x 3.75' quarter quadrangle with a 300 meter buffer on all four sides. The NAIP imagery is formatted to the UTM coordinate system using the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). The NAIP imagery may contain as much as 10% cloud cover per tile. The quarter quads have been reprojected from UTM 11 or UTM 12 to IDTM83 projection (ESPG 102605), mosaicked into 100k tiles, and compressed using ERDAS Imagine for use in ArcGIS.Report: Deegan, SE. 1978.

Monthly mean sea level (MSL) variations were analyzed for 128 stations of the National Ocean Service's (NOS) National Water Level Observation Network (NWLON) having between 30 and 146 years of data. The sea level variations determined are the linear trend, the average seasonal cycle, and the interannual variability at each station. Monthly data up to the end of 2006 were used in the calculation and all stations had data spanning a period of 30 years or more. Since the derived trends include the local vertical land motion, they are spatially variable. Calculated MSL trends range from 9.85 mm/yr for Grand Isle, LA to -16.68 mm/yr for Skagway AK, and are consistent with previous trends published by NOS. Available data from this project include time series plots for each station of the monthly MSL with the seasonal cycle removed, a 5-month average, and the linear trend with its 95% confidence interval which was obtained after accounting for the average seasonal cycle; the seasonal cycle; the Interannual variation of mean sea level for all data to 2006; and the Interannual variation from 1980 to the present (updated monthly). The location and timing of any major earthquakes near stations in tectonically-active areas are noted since an associated vertical offset or a change in MSL trend is possible.NOAA OceanWatch provides sea surface temperature (SST) products derived from microwave sensors, which can measure ocean temperatures even in the presence of clouds.

More than 150 limestone caves are known to exist in or near the island of Bermuda. Many of these caves have extensive but relatively shallow submerged portions that connect to the sea via tidal springs along the coastline. These inland caves are inhabited by a number of diverse eyeless and colorless crustaceans and other invertebrates. Many of these organisms are "living fossils"; and some are most closely related to deep-sea organisms. While previous investigations of marine caves have been limited to those within shallow depths (less than 50 meters/164 feet), current research suggests that caves can occur at almost any depth within the sea. The geological history of Bermuda, coupled with biological evidence (cave-adapted species), indicates a strong possibility for the presence of deep-water caves near the island. Thus, Bermuda offers an idea location to search for and to study deep-water caves.Department of Economics - University of OxfordThe information, citations, and hypothetical examples provided in this report highlight how basic principles and assessments are essential components of the regulatory and policy decision-making process.

The Diablo Canyon project study is located in San Luis Obispo County, California, and encompasses approximately 10,634 acres (43.03 square kilometers). Watershed Sciences, Inc. (WSI) collected Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data on both the inland and intertidal land within the Diablo Canyon study area on 28 January 2010. For optimal capture of the intertidal zone, WSI acquired LiDAR data of the coastline during seasonal low tides (between 0.0 ft and peak low of around 1.5 ft) and in conjunction with a PDOP value of less than 3.0. This LiDAR survey utilized a Leica ALS50 Phase II laser system. The sensor scan angle was +/- 13 from nadir with a pulse rate designed to yield an average native density of more than 8 pulses per square meter over terrestrial surfaces. The area of interest was surveyed with an opposing flight line side-lap of equal-to-or-more-than 50% (equal-to-or-more-than 100% overlap) to reduce laser shadowing and increase surface laser painting.Stationary Point Counts at 4 stations at each survey site were surveyed as part of Rapid Ecological Assessments (REA) conducted at 6 sites around Rota in the Marianas Archipelago (MA) during 3 September - 1 October 2005 in the NOAA Oscar Elton Sette (OES 0511) Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program (RAMP) Cruise.

Towboard surveys) are conducted by the Coral Reef Ecosystem Division (CRED) of the NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC) as part of biennial Pacific Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program (RAMP) Cruises. These cruises support NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program (CRCP) long-term goals for sustainable management and conservation of coral reef ecosystems. 5 towboard surveys (11.5592 km in length), were conducted at Laysan Island in the NW Hawaiian Islands from 12 September - 12 October 2008 as part of RAMP Cruise HI0809. Towboard surveys are a good method for obtaining a general description of large reef areas, assessing the status of low-density populations of large-bodied reef fish, large-scale disturbances (e.g., bleaching), general distribution and abundance patterns of macro-invertebrates (e.g., COT, giant clams), and for assessing trends in these populations and metrics. A pair of scuba divers (1 fish and 1 benthic diver) are towed 60 m behind a small survey launch at a speed of 1-2 knots and a depth of approximately 15m. Each survey is 50 min long, covers about 2 km of habitat, and is divided into ten 5-minute survey segments. The fish diver records, to the lowest possible taxon, all large-bodied reef fishes (>50cmTL) seen within 5m either side and 10m in front of the towboard. Length of each individual is estimated to the nearest cm. The fish towboard is also outfitted with a forward-facing digital video camera to record the survey swath. The benthic diver records percent cover of coral and macroalgae, estimates benthic habitat type and complexity, and censuses a suite of benthic macroinvertebrates including Crown of Thorns sea stars and sea urchins. The benthic towboard is equipped with a downward-facing digital still camera which images the benthos at 15 second intervals. These images are analyzed for percent cover of coral, algae, and other benthic components. Both towboards are equipped with SEABIRD SBE-39 temperature/depth sensors set to record at 5 second intervals. Latitude and longitude of each survey track is recorded at 15 second intervals using a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver onboard the tow boat. A layback algorithm is applied to more accurately map the position of the divers with respect to the reef environment. This algorithm calculates the position of the divers based on the position of the tow boat taking into account the length of the tow rope, the depth of the divers, and the curvature of the survey track.

ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) are approximate area representations of U.S. Postal Service (USPS) ZIP Code service areas that the Census Bureau creates to present statistical data from Census 2000. The Census Bureau creates ZCTAs for the United States, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands for the 2010 Census. Data users should not use ZCTAs to identify the official USPS ZIP Code for mail delivery. The USPS makes periodic changes to ZIP Codes to support more efficient mail delivery. For the 2010 Census, ZCTAs should more accurately represent the actual ZIP Codes at the time of their delineation than they did for Census 2000. This is because that before the tabulation blocks, which the ZCTAs are built from, were delineated for the 2010 Census, the Census Bureau undertook the process of inserting lines that could be used as 2010 Census tabulation block boundaries, and these lines split polygons where the result would be that a significant number of addresses would occur on either one or both sides of the line associated with a single ZIP Code. Each 2010 Census tabulation block that contains addresses is assigned to a single ZCTA, usually to the ZCTA that reflects the most frequently occurring ZIP Code for the addresses within that tabulation block. As a result, ZIP Codes associated with address ranges found in the Address Ranges relationship file may not always match the ZCTA. Blocks that do not contain addresses but are completely surrounded by a single ZCTA (enclaves) are assigned to the surrounding ZCTA. A ZCTA may not exist for every USPS ZIP Code. Some ZIP Codes may not have a matching ZCTA because too few addresses were associated with the specific ZIP Code or the ZIP Code was not the most frequently occurring ZIP Code within any of the blocks were it exists. The Census Bureau uses the addresses stored within MTDB to delineate ZCTAs, and at the time of the 2010 Census the MTDB primarily included addresses for residential or at least potentially residential structures, so ZCTAs representing only non-residential structures are infrequent. Also, in each tabulation block, if a choice existed between using a potential city-style mail delivery ZIP Code for an address or a post office box ZIP Code, the city-style mail delivery ZIP Code was preferred for the 2010 Census ZCTA delineation. The Census Bureau identifies 5-digit ZCTAs using a five-character numeric code that represents the most frequently occurring USPS ZIP Code within that ZCTA, and this code may contain leading zeros.The purpose of this project is to investigate the toxic effects of four wildland firefighting foams on Myxobolus cerebralis, the causative agent of Whirling Disease.

This data set is different from some existing surface air temperature data sets in: (1) using a combination of two large individual data sets of station observations collected from the Global Historical Climatology Network version 2 and the Climate Anomaly Monitoring System (GHCN + CAMS), so it can be regularly updated in near real time with plenty of stations and (2) some unique interpolation methods, such as the anomaly interpolation approach with spatially-temporally varying temperature lapse rates derived from the observation-based Reanalysis for topographic adjustment. When compared with several existing observation-based land surface air temperature data sets, the preliminary results show that the quality of this new GHCN + CAMS land surface air temperature analysis is reasonably good and the new data set can capture most common temporal-spatial features in the observed climatology and anomaly fields over both regional and global domains. The study also reveals that there are clear biases between the observed surface air temperature and the existing Reanalysis data sets, and they vary in space and seasons. Therefore the Reanalysis 2 m temperature data sets may not be suitable for model forcing and validation. The GHCN + CAMS data set will be mainly used as one of land surface meteorological forcing inputs to derive other land surface variables, such as soil moisture, evaporation, surface runoff, snow accumulation and snow melt, etc. As a byproduct, this monthly mean surface air temperature data set can also be applied to monitor surface air temperature variations over global land routinely or to verify the performance of model simulation and prediction. Refer to this paper: Fan, Y. and H. van den Dool, 2008: A global monthly land surface air temperature analysis for 1948-present. J. Geophys. Res., 113, doi: 10.1029/2007JD008470.Dr. Christopher Jenkins of the University of Colorado Institute for Arctic and Alpine Research (INSTAAR), produced this data hypercube derived from the prime data (exclusive of G.R.A.P.E. and logging data) of the Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP). The Deep-Sea Drilling Project legacy data on the lithologies and physical properties of core recoveries is reprocessed into a uniformly formatted, integrated dataset which can be worked on in a wide range of software applications for query, analysis, mapping and visualization. The goal is to create a dataset which is able to be used efficiently across many science disciplines, especially in the fields of global change, ocean management and earth sciences research. The hypercube data model allows scientists and others to easily comprehend and work with the data layout and content. The integration has employed methods of standardization, linguistic parsing, error trapping, uncertainty analysis, and presentation that have developed and been validated over a decade of use in dbSEABED, for marine ecology, resources, engineering, research and survey. Nevertheless integration of the DSDP dataset has been challenging, not all the DSDP data could be treated successfully.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

The HAPC designation alone does not confer additional protection or restrictions to an area, but helps to focus EFH conservation, management, and research priorities. HAPC designation is a valuable way to acknowledge areas where we have detailed information on ecological function and habitat vulnerability, indicating a greater need for conservation and management. In some instances the Councils and NMFS may develop fishery management measures to conserve the habitat within the HAPC.HAPCs are a subset of EFH that deserve special attention because they provide extremely important ecological functions and/or are especially vulnerable to degradation. For instance, HAPC designation may be warranted for areas that play a vital role in the reproductive cycle of a managed species (e.g., grouper spawning sites) or areas that contain a rare habitat type (e.g., corals) that may be sensitive to disturbance from fishing or other human activities.Councils may designate an area as a HAPC for one or more of the following reasons:The habitat provides important ecological functionsThe habitat is sensitive to human-induced environmental degradationDevelopment activities are, or will be, stressing the habitatThe habitat type is rare.Near real-time list of earthquakes recently occurring anywhere in the world.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

This survey was conducted under the Protection of Wrecks Act (1973) contract and the data is Crown Copyright . The data were acquired and processed by Wessex Archaeology. The marine geophysical surveys targeted a total of nine suspected wreck locations in Milford Haven area, off the coast of South Wales, seven of which represent the locations for the remains of 19th century Welsh vessels associated with the coal mining industry. Additional survey data were acquired over two 20th century sites within the Milford Haven, the Thor and the Sunderland. The acquisition of these data aimed to assist RCAHMW maritime team and the Sunderland Trust with on-going archaeological research and fund-raising. The marine geophysical surveys also targeted a total of ten suspected and known wreck site locations off the coast of Lleyn peninsula in North Wales. These included eight unconfirmed positions of 19th century Welsh vessels associated with the slate mining industry, two designated sites the Diamond and the Tal-Y-Bont, and the marine hazard of St Patrick s Causeway with the aim of discovering new wreck sites. The project aimed to acquire marine geophysical data consisting of high resolution sidescan sonar and magnetic gradiometer data over a total of total of 21 known and suspected wreck positions and along the known marine hazard of St. Patrick s Causeway. Since the sites were located in two different areas, they were surveyed during two separate surveys from the Pembroke based vessel Blue Shark. The first session surveyed sites mostly off Milford Haven in south Wales between 17th and 18th April 2010. The second session surveyed sites off the coast of Lleyn peninsula and along St. Patrick s Causeway in north Wales between 23rd April 2010 and 2nd May 2010 with a day of mobilisation and a day of demobilisation at the start and end of the survey session.

Data coverage generally extends along the coastline from the waterline inland 500 meters (topography) and offshore 1,000 meters or to laser extinction (bathymetry). The topographic lidar sensor has a pulse repetition rate of 9 kHz at 1064 nm (near-infrared wavelength). The bathymetric lidar sensor has a pulse repetition rate of 1 kHz at 532 nm (green wavelength). Native lidar data is not generally in a format accessible to most Geographical Information Systems (GIS). Specialized in-house and commercial software packages are used to process the native lidar data into 3-dimensional positions that can be imported into GIS software for visualization and further analysis. Horizontal positions, provided in decimal degrees of latitude and longitude, are referenced to the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). Vertical positions were referenced to the NAD83 ellipsoid and provided in meters. The National Geodetic Survey's (NGS) GEOID03 model was used to transform the vertical positions from ellipsoid to orthometric heights referenced to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88). The format of the files was LAS version 1.0. The NOAA Coastal Services Center received the data and converted the topo and hydro files from NAVD88 heights to ellipsoid heights using GEOID03. These files were converted for data storage and Digital Coast provisioning purposes. The data are classified as: 1 - Unclassified 2 - Ground 11 - BathymetryGEOTRACES, An International Study of Marine Biogeochemical Cycles of Trace Elements and their IsotopesProject is designed to integrate studies from a number of researchers compiling data from terrestrial, marine, and freshwater ecosystems within south Florida.

These multibeam data were collected using SAIC ISS-2000 software in the Generic Sensor Format and processed using SABER editing software. Surface sound velocity values were supplied by a Seabird SBE-45 MicroTSG and a SBE-38 remote temperature probe. Sound velocity corrections from a Seabird 911 CTD sensor and motion corrections from a POS-MV vertical reference were applied to the data in real time. Predicted tides were applied to the data in real time using tide zoning and predicted tides supplied by NOAA's National Ocean Service Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS). At Kure Atoll, Sand Island (1619910) predicted tides were used in zone HI48. At Pearl and Hermes Atoll, Sand Island (1619910) predicted tides were used for zones HI46 and HI47. At Midway island, Sand Island (1619910) predicted tides were used for tide zone HI47.

The National Flood Hazard Layer (NFHL) data incorporates all Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map(DFIRM) databases published by FEMA, and any Letters Of Map Revision (LOMRs) that have been issued against those databases since their publication date. The DFIRM Database is the digital, geospatial version of the flood hazard information shown on the published paper Flood Insurance Rate Maps(FIRMs). The primary risk classifications used are the 1-percent-annual-chance flood event, the 0.2-percent-annual-chance flood event, and areas of minimal flood risk. The NFHL data are derived from Flood Insurance Studies (FISs), previously published Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), flood hazard analyses performed in support of the FISs and FIRMs, and new mapping data where available. The FISs and FIRMs are published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The specifications for the horizontal control of DFIRM data are consistent with those required for mapping at a scale of 1:12,000. The NFHL data contain layers in the Standard DFIRM datasets except for S_Label_Pt and S_Label_Ld. The NFHL is available as State or US Territory data sets. Each State or Territory data set consists of all DFIRMs and corresponding LOMRs available on the publication date of the data set.Data provided by OSM and GeofabrikThe NOAA Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) produces national standardized land cover and change products for the coastal regions of the U.S. C-CAP products inventory coastal intertidal areas, wetlands, and adjacent uplands with the goal of monitoring changes in these habitats, on a one-to-five year repeat cycle. The timeframe for this metadata is reported as 2006-Era, but the actual dates of the Landsat imagery used to create the land cover may have been acquired a few years before or after each era. These maps are developed utilizing Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery, and can be used to track changes in the landscape through time. This trend information gives important feedback to managers on the success or failure of management policies and programs and aid in developing a scientific understanding of the Earth system and its response to natural and human-induced changes. This understanding allows for the prediction of impacts due to these changes and the assessment of their cumulative effects, helping coastal resource managers make more informed regional decisions. NOAA C-CAP is a contributing member to the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics consortium and C-CAP products are included as the coastal expression of land cover within the National Land Cover Database.CATalyst Search CATalyst - Diversity Peer Educators at the University of KentuckySCIAMACHYmC3Bio - The power of plants to power the worldPrograms, projects, laboratories, and publications related to geographic information science in the eastern United StatesThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Branch, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory, federal, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data south of St. Thomas and St. John, USVI, from 3/18/10 to 4/6/09. Data was acquired with a hull-mounted Kongsberg Simrad EM 1002 multibeam echosounder (95 kHz) for water depths greater than 75 meters, and with a moon pool flange-mounted Reson 7125 multibeam echosounder (dual frequecy, 200/400 kHz) for water depths of up to 75 meters. It was processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS software. Data has all correctors applied (attitude, sound velocity) and has been reduced to mean lower low water (MLLW) using final approved tides and zoning from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM zone 20 north, datum NAD83. The processed CARIS data was used to generate a CARIS BASE surface based on CUBE. A BAG file was exported from the BASE surface, and converted to a GeoTIFF in ESRI ArcMap 10. Rugosity was derived from this surface using NOAA?s Benthic Terrain Modeler extension. The project was conducted to meet IHO Order 1 and 2 accuracy standards, dependant on the project area and depth.

NDBC has installed approximately 50 C-MAN stations on lighthouses, at capes and beaches, on near shore islands, and on offshore platforms. NDBC has deployed over 100 moored (a.k.a., weather) buoys in coastal and offshore waters from the western Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean around Hawaii, and from the Bering Sea to the South Pacific. C-MAN and moored buoy data typically include barometric pressure, wind direction, speed and gust, and air temperature; however, some C-MAN stations are equipped to also measure seawater temperature, water level, waves, and relative humidity. Moored buoys measure wave energy spectra from which NDBC derives significant wave height, dominant wave period, and average wave period. In addition, many moored buoys measure the direction of wave propagation. In collaboration, NDBC and the National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) are archiving these data from C-MAN and moored buoys. This NODC Accession is part of the collaboration and it contains netCDF (version 4) files with the data collected during December 2013.Atlassian Confluence Search ProviderDIVA-GIS has published Administrative Boundaries Level 0 in Liberia on their website in support of the Ebola crisis.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

The cloudmask runs a series of tests on each surface temperature pixel to determine whether the pixel is contaminated by cloud cover. Users may evaluate which specific tests in the cloudmask returned positive cloud presence results by examining the value of the cloudmask. This value corresponds to an 8 bit binary number which details which tests flagged the pixel as a cloudy pixel. See http://coastwatch.pfel.noaa.gov/info/CLAVR.html for more information regarding the specific tests used in the cloudmask.A series of pitfall traps were established along the riparian corridor of the lower eight-mile reach of Big Beaver Creek, North Cascades National Park Complex (NOCA), Washington, during the summers of 1995 and 1996. Arthropods are known to represent at least 85% of the biological diversity of all flora and fauna found in the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest in western Oregon. One might expect similar diversity in NOCA. Twelve families of Hemiptera:Heteroptera are reported here from the 1995 and 1996 seasons. Twenty-four genera were recognized representing thirty-two species. Two families, the Miridae and Scutelleridae were mentioned but not treated as were the other species because the specimens of Miridae were in bad condition from the pitfall traps (they are very fragile) and the Scutelleridae (Eurygaster sp.) lacked adequate data. Most of the species were typical inhabitants of the riparian zone (e.g. the Anthocoridae, Lygaeidae, Nabidae, and Saldidae) whereas others in or on the water (e.g. Belostomatidae and Gerridae). A few species were surprises - Aradus orbiculus Van Duzee, a strongly brachypterous specimen, rare, and usually found under bark. Ceratocombus vagans (McAtee and Malloch) is one of the most primitive living Hemiptera:Heteroptera. It is very small (under 2mm) and is a predator in the litter layer in moist habitats. It is a widespread, chiefly boreal species. Stygnocoris sabulosus (Schilling) was the only non-indigenous bug species recovered from the study. It is a well-known European species known to feed on seeds. Barce fraterna banksii (Baker) is a wingless pirate bug and is a predator as are many of the species collected. The two species of Acalypta - A. lillianis (Torre-Bueno) and A. mera (Drake) are very typical moss inhabitants in Northwest forests, especially in clearings or open stands. More collecting indifferent locations and habitats will enhance our knowledge and add rapidly to our general knowledge base for NOCA.

Many reefs are built using objects that were built for other purposes, for example by sinking oil rigs (through the Rigs-to-Reefs program), scuttling ships, or by deploying rubble or construction debris. Other artificial reefs are purpose built (e.g. the reef balls) from PVC or concrete. Shipwrecks may become artificial reefs when preserved on the sea floor. Regardless of construction method, artificial reefs generally provide hard surfaces where algae and invertebrates such as barnacles, corals, and oysters attach; the accumulation of attached marine life in turn provides intricate structure and food for assemblages of fish. This is NOT a complete collection of artificial reefs on the seafloor, nor are the locations to be considered exact. The presence and location of the artificial reefs have been derived from multiple state websites. These data are intended for coastal and ocean planning.

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Block Groups (BGs) are defined before tabulation block delineation and numbering, but are clusters of blocks within the same census tract that have the same first digit of their 4-digit census block number from the same decennial census. For example, Census 2000 tabulation blocks 3001, 3002, 3003,.., 3999 within Census 2000 tract 1210.02 are also within BG 3 within that census tract. Census 2000 BGs generally contained between 600 and 3,000 people, with an optimum size of 1,500 people. Most BGs were delineated by local participants in the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP). The Census Bureau delineated BGs only where the PSAP participant declined to delineate BGs or where the Census Bureau could not identify any local PSAP participant. A BG usually covers a contiguous area. Each census tract contains at least one BG, and BGs are uniquely numbered within census tract. Within the standard census geographic hierarchy, BGs never cross county or census tract boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of other geographic entities like county subdivisions, places, urban areas, voting districts, congressional districts, and American Indian / Alaska Native / Native Hawaiian areas. BGs have a valid code range of 0 through 9. BGs coded 0 were intended to only include water area, no land area, and they are generally in territorial seas, coastal water, and Great Lakes water areas. For Census 2000, rather than extending a census tract boundary into the Great Lakes or out to the U.S. nautical three-mile limit, the Census Bureau delineated some census tract boundaries along the shoreline or just offshore. The Census Bureau assigned a default census tract number of 0 and BG of 0 to these offshore, water-only areas not included in regularly numbered census tract areas.BPI Structures are derived from two scales of a focal mean analysis on bathymetry and slope.

Data from four regional Gap Analysis Projects and the LANDFIRE project were combined to make this dataset. In the northwestern United States (Idaho, Oregon, Montana, Washington and Wyoming) data in this map came from the Northwest Gap Analysis Project. In the southwestern United States (Colorado, Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah) data used in this map came from the Southwest Gap Analysis Project. The data for Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Virginia came from the Southeast Gap Analysis Project and the California data was generated by the updated California Gap land cover project. The Hawaii Gap Analysis project provided the data for Hawaii. In areas of the county (central U.S., Northeast, Alaska) that have not yet been covered by a regional Gap Analysis Project, data from the Landfire project was used. Similarities in the methods used by these projects made possible the combining of the data they derived into one seamless coverage. They all used multi-season satellite imagery (Landsat ETM+) from 1999-2001 in conjunction with digital elevation model (DEM) derived datasets (e.g. elevation, landform) to model natural and semi-natural vegetation. Vegetation classes were drawn from NatureServe's Ecological System Classification (Comer et al. 2003) or classes developed by the Hawaii Gap project. Additionally, all of the projects included land use classes that were employed to describe areas where natural vegetation has been altered. In many areas of the country these classes were derived from the National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD). For the majority of classes and, in most areas of the country, a decision tree classifier was used to discriminate ecological system types. In some areas of the country, more manual techniques were used to discriminate small patch systems and systems not distinguishable through topography. The data contains multiple levels of thematic detail. At the most detailed level natural vegetation is represented by NatureServe's Ecological System classification (or in Hawaii the Hawaii GAP classification). These most detailed classifications have been crosswalked to the five highest levels of the National Vegetation Classification (NVC), Class, Subclass, Formation, Division and Macrogroup. This crosswalk allows users to display and analyze the data at different levels of thematic resolution. Developed areas, or areas dominated by introduced species, timber harvest, or water are represented by other classes, collectively refered to as land use classes; these land use classes occur at each of the thematic levels. Raster data in both ArcGIS Grid and ERDAS Imagine format is available for download at http://gis1.usgs.gov/csas/gap/viewer/land_cover/Map.aspx Six layer files are included in the download packages to assist the user in displaying the data at each of the Thematic levels in ArcGIS.

It provides monthly mean temperature data for 7280 stations from 226 countries and territories, ongoing monthly updates of more than 2000 stations to support monitoring of current and evolving climate conditions, and homogeneity adjustments to remove non-climatic influences that can bias the observed temperature record. The release of version 3 monthly mean temperature data in 2011 introduced a number of improvements and changes from the previous release that included consolidating "duplicate" series, updating records from recent decades, and the use of new approaches to homogenization and quality assurance. The next version of GHCN-Monthly is expected to be released in 2015. Version 4 will contain more than 30,000 stations with monthly mean temperature data and improved quality control and bias correction processes.This data set includes data collected on October 16, 1999 and coastline in the State of Texas from Galveston to the Louisiana border. Laser beach mapping uses a pulsed laser ranging system mounted onboard an aircraft to measure ground elevation and coastal topography. The laser emits laser beams at high frequency and is directed downward at the earth's surface through a port opening in the bottom of the aircraft's fuselage. The laser system records the time difference between emission of the laser beam and the reception of the reflected laser signal in the aircraft. The aircraft travels over the beach at approximately 60 meters per second while surveying from the low water line to the landward base of the sand dunes.This dataset contains age-adjusted incidence rates for 26 malignancy/age group/gender combinations for the years 1999-2009.

In accordance with the desire of many to continuously monitor the environmental health of our estuaries, much can be learned by summarizing existing temporal, geographic, and phylogenetic contaminant information. To this end, retrospective contamiant exposure and effects data for amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals residing within 30 km. of the Atlantic, Gulf, Pacific, Alaskan, and Hawaiian coastal estuaries are being assembled through searches of published literature (e.g., Fish and Wildlife Review; BIOSIS) and databases (e.g., US EPA Ecological Incident Information System; USGS Diagnostic and Epizootic Databases), and compilation of summary data from unpublished reports of government natural resource agencies, private conservation groups, and universities. These contaminant vertebrates (CEE-TV) are being summarized using ACCESS in a 120 field format including species, collection time and site coordinates, sample matrix, contaminant concentration, biomarker and bioindicator responses, and source of information. This CEE-TV database (>11,000 records) has been imported into the ARC/INFO geographic information system (GIS), for purposes of examining geographic coverage and trends, and to identify critical data gaps. A preliminary risk assessment has been conducted to identify and characterize contaminants and other stressors potentially affecting terrestrial vertebrates that reside, migrate through or reproduce in these estuaries.Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences Search Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences -Links to hundreds of map layers of geospatial information listed by subjects for use with the National Atlas Map Maker to assemble, view, and print customized maps using one or more of the layers.Private Water District boundaries are areas where private contracts provide water to the district in California.

Such an oil spill could be caused by accidents involving oil tankers or oil drilling platforms, such as the recent explosion of Deep Water Horizon (DWH) off the coast of Louisiana in the Gulf of Mexico. In the event of such an accident, remote sensing imagery from both airborne and space-borne platforms are normally used to track and map the spread of oil slicks. The oil spectral reflectance features could be an important source for oil spill detection and mapping. Since hyperspectral imagery can provide detailed spectral information for the above purposes, hyperspectral remote sensing data have been collected since the DWH accident. Examples of the hyperspectral data include AVIRIS (airborne) and Hyperion (space-borne). Designed for more general purposes, such spectral resolution might not be optimal for oil detection in coastal waters in the current crisis. This paper describes the effort to evaluate a portable pushbroom prism-grating-prism imaging spectrometer to measure oil and coastal water at low flying altitude near the DWH accident site. The compact size of such a sensor allows for easy integration with other sensors on a single platform. The array size of the imaging spectrometers detector is 1600 x 1200. With a vertical binning of 4 in data acquisition, it can provide a spectral resolution of 2.6 nm with approximately 1m GSD. Several missions were flown in late July of 2010. Image data of possible oil and sheen was collected and their spectral signature was analyzed. The study found some red patches or red linear feature in the coastal water that were identified as oil that might be sargassum based on its reflectance spectra. These features could be mislabeled as oil slick during normal aerial survey missions. Hyperspectral images thus provide a useful way for oil slick detection and also to minimize false alarms. It is expected this study would provide detailed information to describe spectral characteristics of oil in coastal water and might lead to new sensor design/integration for oil leak detection and mapping in coastal waters.The CO-OPS Station Map has many features designed to provide a quick and easy way to find a CO-OPS station, and to view real-time observations as well as plot the last 48 hours of dataSCAR initiates, develops and coordinates scientific research in the Antarctic region and provides objective independent scientific advice to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings.search hackpadConcerted effort to monitor, analyze, and record sightings of non-native (introduced) aquatic species throughout the United States.

Elevation measurements were collected over the area using the NASA Experimental Advanced Airborne Research Lidar (EAARL), a pulsed laser ranging system mounted onboard an aircraft to measure ground elevation, vegetation canopy, and coastal topography. The system uses high-frequency laser beams directed at the Earth's surface through an opening in the bottom of the aircraft's fuselage. The laser system records the time difference between emission of the laser beam and the reception of the reflected laser signal in the aircraft. The plane travels over the target area at approximately 50 meters per second at an elevation of approximately 300 meters. The EAARL, developed by NASA at Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia, measures ground elevation with a vertical resolution of +/-15 centimeters. A sampling rate of 3 kilohertz or higher results in an extremely dense spatial elevation dataset. Over 100 kilometers of coastline can be surveyed easily within a 3- to 4-hour mission. When subsequent elevation maps for an area are analyzed, they provide a useful tool to make management decisions regarding land development. For more information on Lidar science and the Experimental Advanced Airborne Research Lidar (EAARL) system and surveys, see http://ngom.usgs.gov/dsp/overview/index.php and http://ngom.usgs.gov/dsp/tech/eaarl/index.php .In 1975 the BRGM and CNEXO in France joined to create a national marine geological sampling center at the Centre Oceanologique de Bretagne in Brest. This center collects and stores samples of the sea bottom and subbottom from all over the world and makes them available to any person or institution interested in their study. A French national scientific commission defined the rules for collecting operating and using this facility. The commission consists of the representatives of the Ministry of Industry, industrial and oil firms, the main sea ports and Universities as well as of BRGM and CNEXO, which preside in turn every two years over the commission.BRGM is in charge of the management of the Center. Not only geological samples but also related data are stored such as geographical location, depth, weight and number or level, related studies, if any, etc. (the list of published studies is included). The samples and related data are identified by computer cards and are stored in computer files. After verification they are transferred to a data bank which integrates information from the lithotheque, phototheque and data collections for more complete processing. Institutions and persons interested in the cores may request the catalog of the already processed samples or may receive portions of samples for study following approval by the Commission. A copy of the lithotheque was transmitted to the World Data Center for Marine Geology and Geophysics, Boulder for distribution in 1985. More current information is available from BRGM. The data at the WDC (NGDC) include descriptions of approximately 25,000 samples.IPR Holder: Other - See INFORM; Purpose: Safety of navigation; IHO Sea: Inner Seas off the West Coast of Scotland - 18; Survey Start: 2001-02-12; Survey End: 2001-02-12; Primary Instrument Type: Echosounder - single beam; Primary Navigation Type: Not Known; Information: Owned by Larne Harbour Authority;The regions onThis map represent areas with similar hydrogeologic characteristics thought to represent similar potentials for contamination of groundwater and/or water wells.

These land surface form classes were created as part of an effort to map standardized, terrestrial ecosystems for the nation using a classification developed by NatureServe (Comer and others, 2003). Ecosystem distributions were modeled using a biophysical stratification approach developed for South America (Sayre and others, 2008) and now being implemented globally (Sayre and others, 2007). Land surface forms strongly influence the differentiation and distribution of terrestrial ecosystems, and are one of the key input layers in the ecosystem delineation process. The methodology used to produce these land surface form classes was developed by the Missouri Resource Assessment Partnership (MoRAP). MoRAP made modifications to Hammond's (1964a, 1964b) land surface form classification, which allowed the use of 30-meter source data and a 1 km2 window for neighborhood analysis (True 2002, True and others, 2000). While Hammond's methodology was based on three variables, slope, local relief, and profile type, MoRAP's methodology uses only slope and local relief (True 2002). Slope is classified as gently sloping or not gently sloping using a slope threshold of 8%, local relief is classified into five classes (0-15m, 15-30m, 30-90m, 90-150m, and >150m), and eight landform classes (flat plains, smooth plains, irregular plains, escarpments, low hills, hills, breaks, and low mountains) were derived by combining slope class and local relief. The USGS implementation of the MoRAP methodology was executed using the USGS 30-meter National Elevation Dataset (NED) and an existing USGS slope dataset. In this implementation, a new land surface form class, the high mountains/deep canyons class, was identified by using an additional local relief class (> 400m). The drainage channels class was derived independently from the other land surface form classes. This class was derived using two of Andrew Weiss's slope position classes, "valley" and "lower slope" (Weiss 2001, Jenness 2006). The USGS implemented Weiss's algorithm using the 30-meter NED and a 1 km2 neighborhood analysis window. The resultant drainage channel class was combined into the final land surface forms dataset.Scholarship Repository Scholarship Repository DSpace repositorypowered by the HUBzero(R) Platform for Scientific CollaborationOverview of a project to evaluate existing methods used by Virginia Dept. of Transportation to estimate flood hydrographs from small drainage basins, and evaluate the use of dimensionless hydrographs to estimate runoff volumes.This dataset is a subset of the dataset titled ALL CULTRAL POINTS, created by the Arkansas Highway and Transportation Department. Combinations of all of the cultural features are plotted when updating county and city maps in the Mapping Section at the Arkansas State Highway and Transportation DepartmentGiven the location of the critical areas of erosion and the need to avoid adverse impacts to local sensitive habitat, the Southern Monterey Bay Coastal RSM Plan recommends that the coastal area between Wharf II in Monterey to Marina be considered as potential receiver site locations for both subaerial beach and nearshore sand placement. For the latter, the area between the Monterey Beach Resort and the Ocean Harbor House condominiums is considered suitable for three main reasons: The net alongshore sediment transport rate is low and to the north, but the gross transport rate is high in both northerly and southerly directions. This location is fairly central to the southern bight and would allow the sand to be transported most effectively along the whole shoreline. Sand placed at a location further to the north would be unlikely to disperse sufficiently to cover critical areas of erosion towards Monterey Harbor given the overall net transport to the north, and placement further to the south would be too close to the sensitive habitat located offshore. This location is far enough away from the sensitive kelp, eelgrass and rocky reef habitat so as not to cause disturbance through sedimentation or turbidity during construction and post-construction phases of the project. The location is relatively close to a potential stockpile area proposed at Fort Ord where inland sediments, if they become available, could be placed temporarily until a beach nourishment maintenance-style project could be developed. Road access to the location is available. Beach nourishment would occur within the Cities of Sand City, Seaside, and Monterey. The shapefile showing this location was compiled by PWA as a recommendation in the Southern Monterey Bay Coastal Regional Sediment Management Plan (AMBAG, 2008).Mathematical models predict overall streamflow, runoff, subsurface flow, groundwater flow, and soil moisture in this area in response to four different greenhouse gas emission scenarios.Dynamic network of business schools and management development professionals that facilitates learning, accreditation, debate and exchange on best practicesNOAA OceanWatch provides sea surface temperature (SST) products derived from microwave sensors, which can measure ocean temperatures even in the presence of clouds.

This diverse group of explorers included a scientific complement of ichthyologists, geneticists, reproductive biologists, oceanographers, and a hydrographer, along with educators, program managers, two journalists, several graduate students, and even a scientific illustrator. Because of their isolation, seamounts act as an oasis in an otherwise barren landscape, and are known to harbor species found nowhere else. Since most seamounts in the New England chain have never been explored scientifically, there was great potential for new discoveries during this expedition.We estimated mean volumes of 487 million barrels of oil, 9.8 trillion cubic feet of gas, and 408 million barrels of natural gas liquids in this area using a geology-based assessment methodology.This map displays optical validation observation locations and percent coverage of scleractinian coral overlaid on bathymetry.This dataset consists of Level III weather radar products collected from Next-Generation Radar (NEXRAD) stations located in the contiguous United States, Alaska, Hawaii, U.S. territories and at military base sites. NEXRAD is a network of 160 high-resolution Doppler weather radars operated by the NOAA National Weather Service (NWS), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and the U.S. Air Force (USAF). Doppler radars detect atmospheric precipitation and winds, which allow scientists to track and anticipate weather events, such as rain, ice pellets, snow, hail, and tornadoes, as well as some non-weather objects like birds and insects. NEXRAD stations use the Weather Surveillance Radar - 1988, Doppler (WSR-88D) system. This is a 10 cm wavelength (S-Band) radar that operates at a frequency between 2,700 and 3,000 MHz. The radar system operates in two basic modes: a slow-scanning Clear Air Mode (Mode B) for analyzing air movements when there is little or no precipitation activity in the area, and a Precipitation Mode (Mode A) with a faster scan for tracking active weather. The two modes employ nine Volume Coverage Patterns (VCPs) to adequately sample the atmosphere based on weather conditions. A VCP is a series of 360 degree sweeps of the antenna at pre-determined elevation angles and pulse repetition frequencies completed in a specified period of time. The radar scan times 4.5, 5, 6 or 10 minutes depending on the selected VCP. During 2008, the WSR-88D radars were upgraded to produce increased spatial resolution data, called Super Resolution. The earlier Legacy Resolution data provides radar reflectivity at 1.0 degree azimuthal by 1 km range gate resolution to a range of 460 km, and Doppler velocity and spectrum width at 1.0 degree azimuthal by 250 m range gate resolution to a range of 230 km. The upgraded Super Resolution data provides radar reflectivity at 0.5 degree azimuthal by 250 m range gate resolution to a range of 460 km, and Doppler velocity and spectrum width at 0.5 degree azimuthal by 250 m range gate resolution to a range of 300 km. Super resolution makes a compromise of slightly decreased noise reduction for a large gain in resolution. In 2010, the deployment of the Dual Polarization (Dual Pol) capability to NEXRAD sites began with the first operational Dual Pol radar in May 2011. Dual Pol radar capability adds vertical polarization to the previous horizontal radar waves, in order to more accurately discern the return signal. This allows the radar to better distinguish between types of precipitation (e.g., rain, hail and snow), improves rainfall estimates, improves data retrieval in mountainous terrain, and aids in removal of non-weather artifacts. The NEXRAD products are divided in two data processing levels. The lower Level II data are base products at original resolution. Level II data are recorded at all NWS and most USAF and FAA WSR-88D sites. From the Level II quantities, computer processing generates numerous meteorological analysis Level III products. The Level III data consists of reduced resolution, low-bandwidth, base products as well as many derived, post-processed products. Level III products are recorded at most U.S. sites, though non-US sites do not have Level III products. There are over 40 Level III products available from the NCDC. General products for Level III include the base and composite reflectivity, storm relative velocity, vertical integrated liquid, echo tops and VAD wind profile. Precipitation products for Level III include estimated ground accumulated rainfall amounts for one and three hour periods, storm totals, and digital arrays. Estimates are based on reflectivity to rainfall rate (Z-R) relationships. Overlay products for Level III are alphanumeric data that give detailed information on certain parameters for an identified storm cell. These include storm structure, hail index, mesocyclone identification, tornadic vortex signature, and storm tracking information. Radar messages for Level III are sent by the radar site to users in order to know more about the radar status and special product data. NEXRAD data are provided to the NOAA National Climatic Data Center for archiving and dissemination to users. Data coverage varies by station and ranges from May 1992 to 1 day from present. Most stations began observing in the mid-1990s, and most period of records are continuous.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

NOAA is responsible for archiving and distributing the source data as described in this metadata record.Scientists from the Midwater Assessment and Conservation Engineering (MACE) Program of the Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) have conducted summer surveys to estimate the abundance and distribution of walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) on the eastern Bering Sea (EBS) shelf since 1979. Surveys have been conducted either annually or biennially since 1994. The 2012 acoustic-trawl (AT) survey was carried out between 7 June and 10 August aboard the NOAA ship Oscar Dyson. Its primary objective was to collect acoustic and trawl information to estimate walleye pollock midwater abundance and distribution on the U.S. and Russian Bering Sea shelf. Additional survey sampling included conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) and expendable bathythermograph (XBT) casts to characterize the Bering Sea shelf physical environment, and supplemental trawls to improve acoustic species classification and to obtain an index of euphausiid abundance using multiple frequency techniques. A number of specialized sampling devices were used during the survey, including light level sensors; a Simrad ME70 multibeam sonar to image fish schools; an 83-112 bottom trawl modified to sample fish in midwater; a trawl-mounted stereo camera ("Cam-Trawl") designed to identify species and determine size and density of animals as they pass by the camera during a haul, and a small, bottom-moored, trigger camera system to autonomously collect images of fish on the seafloor.WFS Service for RGIS dataset New Mexico, 2010 Census Block Group State-based (715663ba-c1c3-414c-84a7-c671526f8316)Postcard available for downloading and printing.To support a long-term NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program (CRCP) for sustainable management and conservation of coral reef ecosystems, from 25 May - 09 June 2007, line point intercept (LPI) surveys of benthic parameter assessments were conducted, as a part of Rapid Ecological Assessments (REA), during the Pacific Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program (RAMP) Cruise HI0703 in the Marianas Archipelago at biennial intervals by the Coral Reef Ecosystem Division (CRED) at the NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC). During the cruise, 3 REA sites were surveyed at Asuncion Island in the Marianas Archipelago. At the specific REA sites, coral biologists along with algal biologists, marine invertebrate zoologist, and fish biologists entered the water and conducted a fine-scale (~300 m2) and high degree of taxonomic resolution REA survey to assess and monitor species composition, abundance, percent cover, size distribution, diversity, and general health of fish, corals, macro-invertebrates, and algae in shallow-water (< 35 m) habitats. As a part of REA surveys, the line point intercept surveys were used to quantitatively assess average percent live coral cover and other benthic substrates at REA sites. The surveys were conducted along two consecutively-placed 25m transect lines by a coral biologist. All benthic elements falling directly underneath the transect line at 20-cm to 50-cm intervals were recorded as one of nine benthic categories: live coral, dead coral, carbonate pavement, encrusting coralline algae, macroalgae, coral rubble, sand, rock, and other benthic sessile invertebrates. All living benthic elements (e.g., coral, algae, and other invertebrates) were identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible. These data provide the basis for computing quantitative estimates of percent live coral cover, as well as percent cover of the different benthic constituents.This coverage includes arcs, polygons, and polygon labels that describe the generalized geologic age of surface outcrops of bedrock of Europe including Turkey (Albania, Andorra, Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Malta, Monaco, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, San Marino, Serbia and Montenegro, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, United Kingdom and Vatican City.)

The geographic coverage for a single TIGER/Line file is a county or statistical equivalent entity, with the coverage area based on the latest available governmental unit boundaries. The Census TIGER database represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts. However, each county-based TIGER/Line file is designed to stand alone as an independent data set or the files can be combined to cover the whole Nation. The 2006 Second Edition TIGER/Line files consist of line segments representing physical features and governmental and statistical boundaries. This shapefile represents a subset of the 2006 TIGER dataset. It shows the American Indian Tribal Subdivision areas that fall within San Juan County, NM from the 2000 Census data.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

Each offshore area is defined by an API Number corresponding to those in the API Bulletin Number D12A. OPDs are numbered using the United Nations International Map of the World Numbering System, and are generally named for land or hydrographic features contained within the limits of the diagram. This data set contains Official Protraction Diagram (OPD) outlines in ESRI Arc/Info export and Arc/View shape file formats for the BOEM Gulf of Mexico Region. The use of OPDs makes it easier to refer to individual blocks within a region or planning area. These OPD diagrams were clipped along the Submerged Lands Act (SLA) boundary and along lines contained in the Continental Shelf Boundaries (CSB) GIS data files to show only those blocks or portions thereof within federal jurisdiction. Because GIS projection and topology functions can change or generalize coordinates, these GIS files are NOT an OFFICIAL record for the exact OPD boundaries. Only the paper OPD or a digital image of them serves as OFFICIAL records.Official Protraction Diagrams and other cadastre information the BOEM produces are generated in accordance with 30 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 256.8 to support Federal land ownership and mineral resource management. Additional details are available from: http://www.boem.gov/uploadedFiles/BOEM/Oil_and_Gas_Energy_Program/Mapping_and_Data/99-0006.pdfBecause GIS projection and topology functions can change or generalize coordinates, and because shapefiles cannot represent true arcs, these GIS files are considered to be approximate and are NOT an OFFICIAL record for the exact block coordinates or areas.

This is precipitation data. The primary source of data for this file is approximately 2,000 mostly U.S. weather stations operated or managed by the U.S. National Weather Service. Stations are primary, secondary, or cooperative observer sites that have the capability to measure precipitation at 15 minute intervals. This dataset contains 15-minute precipitation data (reported 4 times per hour, if precip occurs) for U.S. stations along with selected non-U.S. stations in U.S. territories and associated nations. It includes major city locations and many small town locations. Daily total precipitation is also included as part of the data record. NCDC has in archive data from most states as far back as 1970 or 1971, and continuing to the present day. The major parameter is precipitation amounts at 15 minute intervals, when precipitation actually occurs.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Branch, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster, as well as federal, university, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data off of St. Thomas and St. John, USVI from 03/28/2011 to 04/14/2011. Data was acquired with a hull-mounted Reson 7125 multibeam echosounder (400 kHz). It was processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS software. Attitude and sound velocity correctors applied to the data. Verified tides were not applied to the data, leaving the depth values referenced to the ellipsoid. The imagery is projected in the UTM Zone 20 north, NAD83 datum. The processed CARIS data was used to generate a CARIS BASE surface based on swath angle. The CARIS Export option "BASE Surface to Image" was then used to create a GeoTiff of the priority areas. Slope was derived from this surface using the slope calculator, a function of ESRIs Spatial Analyst extension.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

Each 1-square-mile cell has a count for the number of unique well boreholes drilled into the SAU. For a given sedimentary basin, the USGS National Geologic CO2 Sequestration Assessment Project identifies SAUs containing the potential for storage and sequestration of carbon dioxide. Proprietary well header data from IHS ENERDEQ through 2010 were queried to determine which wells were drilled into specific SAUs. The coordinates of wells are proprietary and cannot be released; however, counts of the number of wells per square mile are presented in the well drilling density data layer.Search the George Mason University directory.These are Rights-of-Ways (ROW) on Idaho BLM land (and some other Federal agency land) as shown on Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Master Title Plats (MTP). Every GIS ROW feature has a "CASEFILE" value, also known as the serial number of the ROW. This corresponds to the LR2000 database, which is a national BLM database for federal lands information. This GIS ROW feature class can be joined or related to exported information from LR2000 using the "CASEFILE" (GIS) and "SERIAL_NR_FULL" (LR2000) fields. NOTE: the LR2000 information is only available to internal BLM users and is not available to the public as it contains sensitive information. This ROW data for any given area may not be complete due to new ROW activity or because of missed or coincident ROW features during the initial data creation. It is recommended that a thorough inventory of all ROWs in a specific project area be obtained (an LR2000 report can provide this) and the GIS ROW data be checked before using this data for projects needing utmost ROW accuracy. The ROW data that was digitized is what was present on the MTP at the time of the digitizing done for that township. The project was performed over several years. Therefore, the "early" townships digitized are more out of date regarding ROWs compared to the ones more recently digitized. Unfortunately, there is no attribute that indicates the digitizing sequence. Any updates to this ROW feature class should be sent to the BLM Idaho State Office GIS staff for incorporation into the statewide GIS ROW feature classes for improvement over time.WMSA comprehensive database of Alaskan mineral deposits compiled from the published literature and from unpublished reports and data from industry, the US Bureau of Land Management, and USGS.Results from historical (1855-2005) shoreline change analysis demonstrate that tropical cyclone frequency dominates the long-term evolution of this barrier-island arc.Search the Debian website.In 2008, the Monitor National Marine Sanctuary (MNMS) commenced a multiyear project focusing on shipwreck sites associated with the Battle of the Atlantic. During WWII, this was the closest theater of war to the continental United States. Directly off the coast of North Carolina remains a collection of nearly 200 shipwrecks from one of the most significant battles in one of the most historic wars in world history. In previous years, MNMS and partners have collected data and completed archaeological surveys of four sites. Additionally, with OER support, the 2009 field season conducted a multibeam sonar and ROV survey to discover and document previously unknown deep-water shipwrecks. Several targets were identified, which would benefit from more detailed characterization using advanced imaging technology.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

During the cruise, there were 13 surveys in total conducted at REA sites around Rota Island in the Marianas Archipelago. At the specific REA sites, coral biologists along with fish biologists, algal biologists and marine invertebrate zoologist entered the water and conducted a fine-scale (~300 m2) and high degree of taxonomic resolution REA survey to assess and monitor species composition, abundance, percent cover, size distribution, diversity, and general health of fish, corals, macro-invertebrates, and algae in shallow-water (< 35 m) habitats. As a part of REA surveys, the coral belt surveys were focused on quantifying the diversity, abundance, density, and size-class distribution of the anthozoan and hydrozoan corals as well as the condition and health state of the coral reef populations. The surveys were conducted along two consecutively-placed, 25m transect lines. The belt width was dictated at the beginning of each dive by subjective perceived colony density: 1-m width was used in high density areas, while 2-m width was used in low density areas. Within each 25m transect, five 2.5-meter segments were surveyed (beginning at points: 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 meters), whereby in each segment, all coral colonies whose center fell within 0.5m of either side of the transect line were identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible (genus or species) and two planar size metrics were collected: maximum diameter and diameter perpendicular to the maximum diameter. In addition, the extent of mortality, both recent and old, was estimated for each colony. Observers paid special attention to identifying as best as possible the extent of the former live colony. When a coral colony exhibited signs of disease or compromised health, additional information was recorded including type of affliction (bleaching, skeletal growth anomaly, white syndrome, tissue loss other than white syndrome, trematodiasis, necrosis, other, pigmentation responses, algal overgrowth, and predation), severity of the affliction (mild, moderate, marked, severe, acute), as well as photographic documentation and sometimes tissue samples. Tissue samples were catalogued and fixed in buffered zinc-formalin solution for further histopathological analyses. Raw survey data included species presence and relative abundance, colony counts per taxon, size (width and length), mortality, predation, and health status. A surveyed area was ranging from 10m2 to 25m2 per site.Physical, chemical, and temperature profile data were collected using bottle casts, plankton net, fluorometer, and meteorological sensors. Data were collected from GASCOYNE, CHIU LIEN, BOCAS DE CENIZA, A. AGASSIZ, CORIOLIS, and JEAN CHARCOT in the Mediterranean Sea and Pacific Ocean. Data were collected by Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) with support from the Global Ocean Data Archaeology and Rescue Project (GODAR).In collaboration with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration?s (NOAA) Office of Ocean Exploration (OE), the Institute for Exploration (IFE) requests funding to undertake a comparative assessment of the archaeological and biological changes that have occurred at the RMS Titanic wreck site between 1985, the year of its discovery, and the present. As a follow-up to the expedition mounted by OE in June 2003, this field program, with Dr. Robert Ballard and colleagues from OE and other institutions, proposes to re-survey the wreck using state-of-the-art imagery and communications equipment and to broadcast the data real-time via their Inner Space technology. This updated research will help to better determine the wreck?s rate of degradation, produce the first ever comprehensive map of the entire wreck site, and actively engage the public with live video and communication links via the Internet. IFE plans to use its tandem ROV team of Argus and Little Hercules to provide an accurate high-definition map of the wreck site with video imagery. The pair was effectively used in NOAA?s Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary in 2002, where they used high-definition imagery to visually survey more than a dozen wrecks in Lake Huron. IFE will incorporate new methods and technology recently used in their successful Black Sea 2003 Expedition to accurately map the area and coordinate with satellite facilities to transmit the data. Both vehicles will be modified to operate in deep water. In addition, another ROV, Hercules, which was designed explicitly for deep-water archaeological site mapping, can also be modified for biological sampling and precision mapping at the depths of Titanic. Also joining the cruise will be marine biologists, who will continue to conduct rusticle research and bacterial experiments to determine whether or not the current level of microbial activity is the leading cause of the wreck?s degradation. These investigations have proven directly useful to other deep-sea experiments throughout the world, namely marine construction projects and pharmaceutical research.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

This count of every resident in the United States was mandated by Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution and all households in the U.S. and individuals living in group quarters were required by law to respond to the 2010 Census questionnaire. The data collected by the decennial census determine the number of seats each state has in the U.S. House of Representatives and is also used to distribute billions in federal funds to local communities. The questionnaire consisted of a limited number of questions but allowed for the collection of information on the number of people in the household and their relationship to the householder, an individual's age, sex, race and Hispanic ethnicity, the number of housing units and whether those units are owner- or renter-occupied, or vacant. Results for sub-state geographic areas in New Mexico were released in a series of data products. These data come from Summary File 1 (SF-1). The geographic coverage for SF-1 includes the state, counties, places (both incorporated and unincorporated communities), tribal lands, school districts, census tracts, block groups and blocks, among others.

The outer limit of each of these zones is measured from the U.S. normal baseline, which coincides with the low water line depicted on NOAA charts and includes closing lines across the entrances of legal bays and rivers, consistent with international law. The U.S. baseline and associated maritime limits are reviewed and approved through the interagency U.S. Baseline Committee, which is chaired by the U.S. Department of State. The Committee serves the function of gaining interagency consensus on the proper location of the baseline using the provisions of the 1958 Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone, to ensure that the seaward extent of U.S. maritime zones do not exceed the breadth that is permitted by international law. In 2002 and in response to mounting requests for digital maritime zones, NOAA launched a project to re-evaluate the U.S. baseline in partnership with other federal agencies via the U.S. Baseline Committee. The focus of the baseline evaluation was NOAA's largest scale, most recent edition nautical charts as well as supplemental source materials for verification of certain charted features. This dataset is a result of the 2002-present initiative and reflects a multi-year iterative project whereby the baseline and associated maritime limits were re-evaluated on a state or regional basis. In addition to the U.S. maritime limits, the U.S. maritime boundaries with opposite or adjacent countries as well as the US/Canada International Boundary (on land and through the Great Lakes) are also included in this dataset.The Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) operated the drilling vessel JOIDES Resolution from 1984-2003 for over 100 cruises worldwide.

The modeling exercise also explored considerations for development of a more detailed groundwater flow model that would include all of the major aquifers in the Upper Colorado River Basin.Drinking water supply management area (DWSMA) vulnerability is an assessment of the likelihood for a potential contaminant source within the drinking water supply management area to contaminate a public water supply well based on the aquifer's inherent geologic sensitivity; and the chemical and isotopic composition of the groundwater.postdoctoral,U.S.,profession,npa,research,researchers,science,enterprise,postdocs,community, nonprofit, stemThree main criteria are used as an initial basis for screening source locations; availability of large quantities of beach compatible sand, levels of contamination, and the location of the source relative to the potential southern Monterey Bay receiver site. Sediments with contamination are typically eliminated from further consideration for beach nourishment. Potential sources are then targeted, using the Tier I evaluation criteria of the Sand Compatibility and Opportunistic Use Program (SCOUP) Plan (Moffatt and Nichol Engineers, 2006), for more detailed compatibility studies.In this Coastal RSM Plan, available information was collated on the physical and chemical characteristics of the potential source sediments. The essential data include particle size, and chemical signatures (metals and other analytes). This is defined as a Tier I analysis in the SCOUP (Moffatt and Nichol Engineers, 2006). From these data, provisional recommendations are made regarding the suitability of the source sediments for placement at the potential receiver site, which should then be carried forward into a more detailed Tier II analysis. Tier II analysis requires sampling and testing for particle size distribution, chemistry, and physical properties, at each of the source sites and the potential receiver site providing a definitive statement regarding the suitability of the source sediments for placement at the receiver site. The Tier I analysis carried out for this Coastal RSM Plan targets five potential sources of sand for beach nourishment, which are described in Sections 6.1 to 6.5. Locations compiled by PWA for Southern Monterey Bay Coastal Regional Sediment Management Plan (AMBAG, 2008).NOAA's Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) produces national standardized land cover and land change information for the coastal regions of the U.S. C-CAP products inventory coastal intertidal areas, wetlands, and adjacent uplands with the goal of monitoring changes in these habitats every five years.

Elevation measurements were collected over the area using the NASA Experimental Advanced Airborne Research Lidar (EAARL), a pulsed-laser ranging system mounted onboard an aircraft to measure ground elevation, vegetation canopy, and coastal topography. The system uses high-frequency laser beams directed at the Earth's surface through an opening in the bottom of the aircraft's fuselage. The laser system records the time difference between emission of the laser beam and the reception of the reflected laser signal in the aircraft. The plane travels over the target area at approximately 50 meters per second at an elevation of approximately 300 meters. The EAARL, developed by NASA at Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia, measures ground elevation with a vertical resolution of 15 centimeters. A sampling rate of 3 kilohertz or higher results in an extremely dense spatial elevation dataset. Over 100 kilometers of coastline can be surveyed easily within a 3- to 4-hour mission. When subsequent elevation maps for an area are analyzed, they provide managers with a useful tool to make management decisions regarding land development.

NDBC has installed approximately 50 C-MAN stations on lighthouses, at capes and beaches, on near shore islands, and on offshore platforms. NDBC has deployed over 100 moored (a.k.a., weather) buoys in coastal and offshore waters from the western Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean around Hawaii, and from the Bering Sea to the South Pacific. C-MAN and moored buoy data typically include barometric pressure, wind direction, speed and gust, and air temperature; however, some C-MAN stations are equipped to also measure seawater temperature, water level, waves, and relative humidity. Moored buoys measure wave energy spectra from which NDBC derives significant wave height, dominant wave period, and average wave period. In addition, many moored buoys measure the direction of wave propagation. In collaboration, NDBC and the National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) are archiving these data from C-MAN and moored buoys.

A complete set of Redistricting Census 2000 TIGER/Line files includes all counties and statistically equivalent entities in the United States and Puerto Rico. The Redistricting Census 2000 TIGER/Line files will not include files for the Island Areas. The Census TIGER data base represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts. However, each county-based TIGER/Line file is designed to stand alone as an independent data set or the files can be combined to cover the whole Nation. The Redistricting Census 2000 TIGER/Line files consist of line segments representing physical features and governmental and statistical boundaries. The Redistricting Census 2000 TIGER/Line files do NOT contain the ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) and the address ranges are of approximately the same vintage as those appearing in the 1999 TIGER/Line files. That is, the Census Bureau is producing the Redistricting Census 2000 TIGER/Line files in advance of the computer processing that will ensure that the address ranges in the TIGER/Line files agree with the final Master Address File (MAF) used for tabulating Census 2000. The files contain information distributed over a series of record types for the spatial objects of a county. There are 17 record types, including the basic data record, the shape coordinate points, and geographic codes that can be used with appropriate software to prepare maps. Other geographic information contained in the files includes attributes such as feature identifiers/census feature class codes (CFCC) used to differentiate feature types, address ranges and ZIP Codes, codes for legal and statistical entities, latitude/longitude coordinates of linear and point features, landmark point features, area landmarks, key geographic features, and area boundaries. The Redistricting Census 2000 TIGER/Line data dictionary contains a complete list of all the fields in the 17 record types.Comit conomique et social europ en Rechercher (Fran ais) Comit conomique et social europ enThe Gridded Satellite (GridSat-B1) data provides a uniform set of quality controlled geostationary satellite observations for the visible, infrared window and infrared water vapor channels. GridSat-B1 uses the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) B1 dataset providing coverage every 3 hours from 1980 to the present, and is updated quarterly as possible. The ISCCP B1 data have been quality controlled, calibrated, remapped and merged together to provide a nearly global coverage of top of the atmosphere radiances. Long-term temporal normalization is performed via calibration against HIRS channel 12 data during the period of record. The IR window channel data has received more extensive inter-satellite calibration and is thus identified as a Climate Data Record (CDR) by the NOAA CDR Program. GridSat-B1 data are projected on an equal angle grid, which facilitates the mapping and subsetting of the data. Since the ISCCP B1 native resolution is approximately 8km, the resolution of the equal area grid is 0.07 degrees latitude (approximately 8km at the Equator). The data span the globe in longitude and range from 70 degrees South to 70 degrees North latitude. GridSat version 2 differs from version 1 in the following ways: a) three channels are provided instead of just one, b) more quality control on the calibration, navigation and flagging of bad data, and c) extension of the period of record. Data are stored using netCDF-4 file format following the Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions and the Attribute Convention for Dataset Discovery (ACDD) which facilitates usage with compatible software applications. Documentation and source code are available for the dataset.Data set contains 5000 by 5000 feet digital orthophotography mosaics. The digital orthophotos in this series have a nominal ground resolution of 0.5 meters. The digital orthophoto mosaics are four band, 12-bit GeoTIFFs and are color balanced to be uniform while still maintaining as much of the original color and appearance as practical. The source imagery was flown on June 28 and 30, 2012 with a Z/I DMC camera. The primary project area includes the entire shoreline of Rhode Island including the coastal ponds or lagoons that are found on the south shore. The shoreline of Block Island is also included in this project. This area includes approximately 943 square kilometers of intertidal and sub tidal habitats.Fish larvae counts and standardized counts for larvae captured in CalCOFI icthyoplankton nets (primarily vertical [Calvet or Pairovet], oblique [bongo or ring nets], and surface tows [Manta nets]). Surface tows are normally standardized to count per 1,000 m3 strained. Oblique tows are normally standardized to count per 10 m2 of surface sampled. This table includes all tows by species, even if zero larvae were captured for the species, i.e., negative tows. The \\\\"Larvae Counts Positive Tows\\\\" table includes only tows where one or more larvae were captured for the species selected by the user.The TIGER/Line Files are shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) that are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Block Groups (BGs) are defined before tabulation block delineation and numbering, but are clusters of blocks within the same census tract that have the same first digit of their 4-digit census block number from the same decennial census. For example, Census 2000 tabulation blocks 3001, 3002, 3003,.., 3999 within Census 2000 tract 1210.02 are also within BG 3 within that census tract. Census 2000 BGs generally contained between 600 and 3,000 people, with an optimum size of 1,500 people. Most BGs were delineated by local participants in the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP). The Census Bureau delineated BGs only where the PSAP participant declined to delineate BGs or where the Census Bureau could not identify any local PSAP participant. A BG usually covers a contiguous area. Each census tract contains at least one BG, and BGs are uniquely numbered within census tract. Within the standard census geographic hierarchy, BGs never cross county or census tract boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of other geographic entities like county subdivisions, places, urban areas, voting districts, congressional districts, and American Indian / Alaska Native / Native Hawaiian areas. BGs have a valid code range of 0 through 9. BGs coded 0 were intended to only include water area, no land area, and they are generally in territorial seas, coastal water, and Great Lakes water areas. For Census 2000, rather than extending a census tract boundary into the Great Lakes or out to the U.S. nautical three-mile limit, the Census Bureau delineated some census tract boundaries along the shoreline or just offshore. The Census Bureau assigned a default census tract number of 0 and BG of 0 to these offshore, water-only areas not included in regularly numbered census tract areas.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

The R-factor is one of the parameters used by the Revised Unified Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) to estimate annual rates of erosion. This product is a raster representation of R-Factor derived from isoerodent maps published in the Agriculture Handbook Number 703 (Renard et al.,1997). Lines connecting points of equal rainfall ersoivity are called isoerodents. The iserodents plotted on a map of the Island of Oahu were digitized, then values between these lines were obtained by linear interpolation. The final R-Factor data are in raster GeoTiff format at 30 meter resolution in UTM, Zone 4, GRS80, NAD83.WMSLibrary Catalog may include: Data Management Plans, Cruise Plans, Cruise Summary Reports, Scientific "Quick Look Reports", Video Annotation Logs, Image Collections, Highlight Images, Video Collections, Highlight Video Clips, Dive Plans, Dive Summary Reports, Maps, Essays, News Articles, Presentations, Education Lesson Plans, Biographies, Web Logs/Summaries.Information concerning status and trends of biological resources, focusing on Diptera (flies)Gephi:Wiki (en)ArcIMS 9.2.0 DBCPN Web Map ServiceThe Global Forecast System (GFS) is a weather forecast model produced by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). Dozens of atmospheric and land-soil variables are available through this dataset, from temperatures, winds, and precipitation to soil moisture and atmospheric ozone concentration. The entire globe is covered by the GFS at a base horizontal resolution of 18 miles (28 kilometers) between grid points, which is used by the operational forecasters who predict weather out to 16 days in the future. Horizontal resolution drops to 44 miles (70 kilometers) between grid point for forecasts between one week and two weeks. The GFS model is a coupled model, composed of four separate models (an atmosphere model, an ocean model, a land/soil model, and a sea ice model), which work together to provide an accurate picture of weather conditions. Changes are regularly made to the GFS model to improve its performance and forecast accuracy. This dataset is run four times daily at 00z, 06z, 12z and 18z out to 384 hours in two parts. The forecast steps out to 192 hours have a 1.0 degree horizontal resolution and a 3 hour temporal resolution. Forecast steps from 192 to 384 hours have a 2.5 degree horizontal resolution and a 12 hour temporal resolution.Of 129 reported incidents, 94 are confirmed ash encounters, 79 of which entailed airframe or engine damage; 20 are low-severity events involving suspected ash or gas clouds; for 15 the data are insufficient to assess severity.Summarizes the expected value over the next decade of the 3D Elevation Program for this state.This data set consists of one-foot pixel resolution, natural color orthoimages covering the urban area footprint. An orthoimage is remotely sensed image data in which displacement of features in the image caused by terrain relief and sensor orientation have been mathematically removed. Orthoimagery combines the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map. Each orthoimage provides imagery over a 5000-foot by 5000-foot block on the ground. There is no image overlap between adjacent files.

NOAA is responsible for archiving and distributing the source data as described in this metadata record.Orthophotos combine the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map. The primary digital orthophoto quarter quadrangle (DOQQ) is a1-meter ground resolution, quarter-quadrangle (3.75 minutes of latitude by 3.75 minutes of longitude) image cast on the Universal Transverse Mercator projection (UTM) on the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). The geographic extent of the DOQQ is equivalent to a quarter-quadrangle plus the over edge ranges from a minimum of 50 meters to a maximum of 300 meters beyond the extremes of the primary and secondary corner points. The over edge is included to facilitate tonal matching for mosaicing and for the placement of the NAD83 and secondary datum corner ticks. The normal orientation of data is by lines (rows) and samples (columns). Each line contains a series of pixels ordered from west to east with the order of the lines from north to south. This series of DOQQs was produced as a part of the Arkansas Digital Orthophotography Program headed by the Arkansas State Land Information Board and the Arkansas Geographic information Office. The aerial photography used to create the digital images was flown between January 15th and March 31st in 2006.The Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) operated the drilling vessel JOIDES Resolution from 1984-2003 for over 100 cruises worldwide. The ODP was funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation and several countries through the Joint Oceanographic Institutions (JOI). In 1992, the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) placed most of the core data from legs 101-129 of the ODP onto CDROM in cooperation with NSF and JOI. The data are from an ODP relational database system in place prior to the later, JANUS, system. Not all of the data in this archive were transferred to JANUS, so some data files are unique. In 2001, the CDROM was replaced by a new version with an HTML interface, and also placed online. Data types included are: Age profile, carbon-carbonate, corelog, gas chromatography, gamma ray attenuation porositoy evaluator (GRAPE) special 2-minute counts, hard-rock visual core descriptions, hard-rock thin section descriptions, index properties of sediment, interstitial water chemistry, paleomagnetic susceptibility and intensity, rock evaluator data, sedimentary lithology, site summary, smearslide descriptions, velocity, and x-ray fluorescence data.Lists of largest earthquakes in the world and in the United States, earthquake facts and statistics, deaths from earthquakes, earthquakes by magnitude, and significant earthquakes.Short summaries of long-term research projects concerning the biological health of this section of the Mississippi river.311 undersea features from all major oceans and seas has been created as an aid for retrieving georeferenced information resources.Powered by the HUBzero(R) Platform for Scientific CollaborationThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

The data are summarized by quarter degree cells and represent the time weighted average of drift direction and velocity for all drift buoys that entered the cell during the summary time period. Twelve of the data sets are one month averages, one data set is a one year average from all the months. The area covered is nominally the eastern Gulf of Mexico, but during the course of the study, the buoys drifted as far west as Texas. These spatial extent, object count and range attribute metadata items apply in particular to the one-year average data set, however the general characteristics of the dataset (coordinate system, attributes and attribute definitions) apply to all thirteen.Describes and illustrates how scientists use electronic tiltmeters measuring deformation on volcanoes.Densities of the code goby Gobiosoma robustum Ginsburg and clown goby Microgobius gulosus (Girard) vary across regions of Florida Bay. Although their distributions overlap to a limited degree, G. robustum is found in great abundance in the seagrass beds of the western and southern portion of the bay, where a strong Gulf of Mexico influence maintains salinities at a relatively constant level (35-40 ppt). Conversely, M. gulosus is most common in the north-eastern section of the bay that is influenced by freshwater inflow and generally is characterised by lower salinities and sparse submerged vegetation.Consistent, historic, and up-to-date ground-water data, such as water levels collected at wells and springs, are available from the USGS National Water Information System as graphs, tables, or files to download.Data.Medicare.Govkulturmasche Search kulturmasche - Die Masche mit der KulturU.S.V.I. maximum monthly precipitationThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

Data was acquired with a pole-mounted Reson 8101 ER multibeam echosounder (240 kHz) and processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS v5.4 software. Data has all correctors applied (attitude, sound velocity) and has been reduced to mean lower low water (MLLW) using final approved tides and zoning from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM zone 20 north, datum NAD83. The processed CARIS data was used to generate a CARIS BASE surface based on swath angle. An ASCII XYZ file was exported from the BASE surface and opened in ESRI ArcMap 9 as an XY event. Then the ArcToolbox conversion tool 'Feature to Raster' was used to generate an ESRI Grid of bathymetry. Finally, the Slope calculator within ArcGIS Spatial Analyst/Surface Analysis was used to calculate slope in degrees, using that ESRI Grid of source bathymetry.The project was conducted to meet IHO Order 1 and 2 accuracy standards, dependant on the project area and depth.

Rugosity is defined as the ratio of surface area to planar area and is used as a measure of benthic terrain complexity or "roughness". Rugosity values near 1 represent flat, smooth terrain, while higher values reflect increasing rugosity or terrain roughness. For rugosity grid interpretation, it is recommended that the grid be reclassified according to standard deviation divisions. NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Branch, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory, federal, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data in Puerto Rico from 2/25/08 to 3/8/08.

This map service is used in an application highlighted on the Great Lakes Coastal Resilience Planning Guide (http://greatlakesresilience.org/?page_id=867).powered by the HUBzero(R) Platform for Scientific CollaborationWell logr data from Energy and Geoscience Institute - The University of UtahThis dataset contains a unified ESRI Grid with 2x2 meter cell size representing the rugosity of a selected portion of seafloor southwest of Vieques Island, derived from data collected in March and April 2009. Rugosity is defined as the ratio of surface area to planar area and is used as a measure of benthic terrain complexity or "roughness". Rugosity values near 1 represent flat, smooth terrain, while higher values reflect increasing rugosity or terrain roughness. For rugosity grid interpretation, is recommended that the grid be reclassified according to standard deviation divisions. NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Branch, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory, federal, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data around Vieques Island from 3/26/09 to 4/2/09. Data was acquired with a hull-mounted Kongsberg Simrad EM 1002 multibeam echosounder (95 kHz) for water depths greater than 75 meters, and with a moon pool flange-mounted Reson 7125 multibeam echosounder (dual frequecy, 200/400 kHz) for water depths of less than 75 meters. It was processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS software. Data has all correctors applied (attitude, sound velocity) and has been reduced to mean lower low water (MLLW) using final approved tides and zoning from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM zone 20 north, datum NAD83. The processed CARIS data was used to generate a CARIS BASE surface based on swath angle. An ASCII XYZ file was exported from the BASE surface and opened in ESRI ArcMap 9.x as an XY event. Then the ArcToolbox conversion tool 'Feature to Raster' was used to generate an ESRI Grid of bathymetry. The Benthic Terrain Modeller (BTM) tool, a collection of ArcGIS terrain visualization tools developed by the Oregon State University (OSU) Department of Geosciences and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Coastal Services Center, was used to calculate the rugosity of that bathymetric grid. More information on the specific algorithms used can be found in the BTM's documentation. The project was conducted to meet IHO Order 1 and 2 accuracy standards, dependant on the project area and depth. All users should individually evaluate the suitability of this data according to their own needs and standards.ITS providerWMSRugosity is derived from gridded (20 m cell size) multibeam bathymetry, collected aboard R/V AHI and NOAA ship Hi'ialakai.

There are more than forty institutions and organizations in the greater Monterey Bay area that are currently examining various aspects of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. Marine research conducted in the sanctuary includes long-term monitoring programs that are essential to furthering our understanding, and to determining the health, of the marine ecosystem. SIMoN enables researchers to monitor the sanctuary effectively by integrating the existing monitoring programs and identifying gaps in information. By avoiding duplication of these programs, resources can be more effectively directed towards surveying and characterizing habitats, assessing the impact of natural processes or human activities on specific resources, and long-term monitoring. Finally, SIMoN serves to make the monitoring data available to managers, decision makers, the research community, and the general public. Current projects, maps and graphs, and educational information are organized by subject on the website. In addition, three interactive maps are available which allow users to visualize, analyze and extract spatial data. The SIMoN Standard Viewer provides a wide variety of GIS data layers of various themes and focus. This viewer is useful for comparing spatial data from a wide variety of scientific disciplines. The SIMoN Water Quality Viewer provides GIS data layers relevant to water quality issues in and around the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. Finally the R/V McArthur II Research Cruise Viewer provides GIS data layers and links to video clips and images obtained from the April, 2004 McArthur II survey conducted in the Monterey Bay, Cordell Bank and Gulf of the Farallones national marine sanctuaries.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

One record is presented per site. Each record reports the five letter site acronym, site sequence number, general and specific location information, state abbreviation, state name, degree-minute-second coordinates, decimal degree coordinates, and species information, among other things. The actual site coordinate information is recorded at the time of sampling, if samples were taken at a location other than the nominal site center. The five letter acronym is based on both the general location information and more specific location information (e.g. SFSM is San Francisco-San Mateo Bridge). The file also contains sequence numbers that facilitate geographic manipulation of the data. Sites are numbered sequentially from the northern most site on the U.S. East coast (i.e. Penobscot Bay-Pickering Island) and continue counter-clockwise around the country.Visible and infrared imagery from DMSP Operational Linescan System (OLS) instruments are used to monitor the global distribution of clouds and cloud top temperatures twice each day. The archive data set consists of low resolution global and high resolution regional, imagery recorded along a 3,000 km scan, satellite ephemeris and solar and lunar information. Infrared pixel values correspond to a temperature range of 190 to 310 Kelvins in 256 equally spaced steps. Onboard calibration is performed during each scan. Visible pixels are relative values ranging from 0 to 63 rather than absolute values in Watts per m^2. Instrumental gain levels are adjusted to maintain constant cloud reference values under varying conditions of solar and lunar illumination. Telescope pixel values are replaced by Photo Multiplier Tube (PMT) values at night. A telescope pixel is 0.55 km at high resolution (fine mode) and 2.7 km at low resolution(smooth mode). Low resolution values are the mean of the appropriate 25 high resolution values.Leicester Research Archive Leicester Research Archive DSpace repositoryThe Submarine Ring of Fire 2012 cruise will use the University of Bremen Quest 4000 remotely operated vehicle to locate, map and sample hydrothermal sites at seamounts and spreading centers in the Lau Basin.

Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) modeling software was used to create this ensemble model, which is an average of 10 model replicates. MaxEnt works by analyzing the distribution of environmental variables where species are present, so it can find other areas that meet all of the same environmental constraints. Georeferenced records containing information about mesophotic coral occurrence and environmental predictors describing the seafloors depth, vertical structure, available light, surface temperature, currents and distance from shoreline were used to train MaxEnt. Model performance and accuracy were assessed using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Area Under the Curve (AUC) and a randomly chosen, spatially independent data subset. The average test AUC for this predictive ensemble model was 0.97, and the producers accuracy of this ensemble predictive model was 86.1% (when the habitat suitability threshold = 0.15). The habitat suitability threshold of 0.15 represents the sum of the maximum ROC sensitivity and specificity values. Extreme care should be taken when selecting a habitat suitability threshold because it affects the probability of correctly identifying the presence and absence of mesophotic corals.

Cores were collected and overlying water was replaced with acetate treated water or Control water (Lake GTH 112 hypolimnetic water). Acetate concentrations were 0.2 mM (low acetate) or 2 mM (high acetate) 13C labeled 1-acetate and 13C labeled 2-acetate amendments in GTH 112 hypolimnetic water. Cores were incubated for 4 weeks at ambient Toolik Lake temperature (about 15 deg C),core water was replaced with Lake GTH 112 hypolimnetic water and CH4 flux was measured at 8 deg C over 24 h (ambient O2 condition). Following 24-h flux measurement, overlying water was replaced with N2 purged water (anoxic condition) and CH4 flux was again measured over 24 h. Data report 24 h flux measurement under ambient and anoxic conditions for each treatment (details reported in Hershey et al. 2013 Biogeochemistry 10.1007/s10533-013-9864-y).The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

In 1984, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Office of Marine Geology began a program to map these areas of the EEZ. The U.S. Pacific Coast was the first EEZ region to be mapped and launched the GLORIA (Geological LOng-Range Inclined Asdic) mapping program. The area covered by this survey extended from the Mexican to the Canadian borders and from the continental shelf edge, at about the 400-meter bathymetric contour, to 200 nautical miles from the coast. Survey of the U.S. Pacific West Coast EEZ was completed in four consecutive cruises conducted from late April through mid-August 1984. The collected GLORIA data were processed and digitally mosaicked to produce continuous imagery of the sea-floor. A total of 36 digital mosaics of an approximate 2 degree by 2 degree (or smaller) area with a 50-meter pixel resolution were completed for the region.N/AWe assembled 1.4 million National Ocean Service (NOS) bathymetric soundings from 98 lead-line and single-beam echosounder hydrographic surveys conducted from 1910 to 1999 in Cook Inlet, Alaska. These bathymetry data are available from the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC: http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov), which archives and distributes data that were originally collected by the NOS and others. While various bathymetry data have been downloaded previously from NGDC, compiled, and used for a variety of projects, our effort differed in that we compared and corrected the digital bathymetry by studying the original analog source documents - digital versions of the original survey maps, called smooth sheets. Our editing included deleting erroneous and superseded values, digitizing missing values, and properly aligning all data sets to a common, modern datum. There were six areas where these older surveys were superseded by compilations of reduced-resolution multibeam surveys. We digitized 12,000 features, such as rocky reefs, kelp beds, rocks and islets, adding them to what was originally available, and creating the most thorough source (n = 18,000) of these typically shallow, inshore features. We also digitized 2,418 km of the mainland and 529 km of island shoreline, generally at a resolution of 1:20,000, and digitized 9,271 verbal surficial sediment descriptions from the smooth sheets. The depth surface, shoreline, inshore features, and sediment data sets are mostly produced at a scale of 1:20,000.This data series contains 540 temporal datasets. Wildfire adheres to meteorological enablers and drivers across a spectrum of timescales. However, a majority of downscaling methods are ill suited for wildfire application due the lack of daily timescales and variables such as humidity and winds that are important for fuel flammability and fire spread. Two statistical downscaling methods, the daily Bias-Corrected Spatial Downscaling (BCSD) and the Multivariate Adapted Constructed Analogs (MACA), that directly incorporate daily data were validated over the Western United States with reanalysis data. While both methods outperformed the null interpolation only method, MACA exhibited additional skill in temperature, humidity, wind and precipitation due to its ability to jointly downscale temperature and dew point temperature and its use of analog patterns rather than interpolation. Both downscaling methods exhibited value added information in tracking fire danger indices and periods of extreme fire danger; however, due to its ability to more accurately capture relative humidity and winds, MACA outperformed the daily BCSD.Index of USGS's 0.3meter urban aerial images.Consistent, historic, and up-to-date surface-water data, such as gage height (stage) and streamflow (discharge), collected at major rivers, lakes, and reservoirs, downloadable from the USGS National Water Information System as graphs, tables, or files.Mathematical models predict overall streamflow, runoff, subsurface flow, groundwater flow, and soil moisture in this area in response to four different greenhouse gas emission scenarios.This image represents a 0.5 meter resolution backscatter mosaic of Grammanik Bank, south of St. Thomas, US Virgin Islands.NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Team, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory, federal, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data in the US Virgin Islands from 2/1/05 to 2/12/05. Data was acquired with a pole-mounted Reson 8101 ER multibeam echosounder (240 kHz) and processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS v5.4 software. Data has all correctors applied (attitude, sound velocity) and has been reduced to mean lower low water (MLLW) using final approved tides from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM zone 20 north, datum WGS84. The backscatter component of the bathymetry data were processed by the Hawaii Mapping Research Group (HMRG), University of Hawaii using the HAWAII MR1 Sidescan Sonar Software Suite. The data were corrected for angle varying gain, transmit power and pulse width. Electronic and acoustic noise, such as striping due to across track variations in amplitude and speckling due to transducer motion, were removed.The project was conducted to meet IHO Order 1 and 2 accuracy standards, dependant on the project area and depth. All users should individually evaluate the suitability of this data according to their own needs and standards.Pacific Science Center inspires a lifelong interest in science, math and technology by engaging diverse communities through interactive and innovative exhibits and programs.Paper on the accelerated erosion of the Rio Puerco, a tributary of the Rio Grande in New Mexico, which has deepened and widened its channel, or arroyo, since the settlement of the region.Barrow field campaign data from August 2009.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

The nominal spatial resolution is 1 km and the map layer is based on 1-km AVHRR data. The data were compiled by staff at the National Center for Earth Resources Observation and Science as part of the Global Land Cover Characterization Project. The land cover classes were produced using 1-km AVHRR data from April 1992 to March 1993. Documentation and the original data are available at http://edcsns17.cr.usgs.gov/glcc/. The data available through the National Atlas of the United States are in GeoTIFF format. This is a revised version of the May 2002 map layer, with a corrected shoreline for Greenland.(Version 4.1, updated September 13, 2013) Maritime limits for the United States are measured from the U.S. baseline, recognized as the low-water line along the coast as marked on NOAA's nautical charts in accordance with the articles of the Law of the Sea. The baseline and related maritime limits are reviewed and approved by the interagency U.S. Baseline Committee. The primary purpose of this dataset is to update the official depiction of these maritime limits and boundaries on NOAA's nautical charts. The Office of Coast Survey depicts on its nautical charts the territorial sea (12 nautical miles), contiguous zone (24nm), and exclusive economic zone (200nm, plus maritime boundaries with adjacent/opposite countries). U.S. maritime limits are ambulatory and subject to revision based on accretion or erosion of the charted low water line.

The goal of the project is to produce a worldwide assessment of the undiscovered, technically recoverable oil and gas resources and report these results by the year 2000. To assess the world's petroleum, a sequence of steps is being undertaken proceeding from defining geologic provinces of the world at a comparable scale, allocating oil and gas fields to these provinces, defining petroleum systems within these provinces, and ultimately assessing the undiscovered petroleum potential of selected provinces of the world. A more in-depth discussion of the geologic provinces and their relative ranking in terms of total known petroleum volume is given in USGS Open File Report 97-463 (see Klett and others, 1997). For the World Energy assessment, the world was divided into eight energy regions which correspond approximately with the economic regions of the world as defined by the U.S. Department of State. The Arabian Peninsula portion of Region 2 is represented on this CD-ROM (see insert Reference Map on geologic map). The geology map of the Arabian Peninsula was compiled and synthesized primarily from the U.S. Geological Survey-- Arabian American Oil Company, 1963, 1:2,000,000 scale Geologic map of the Arabian Peninsula. Additional geology in the northern portion of this map for parts of Iraq, Jordan, Syria, Israel, and Lebanon was derived with permission from the 1:5,000,000 scale, 1971 version of the Geologic Map of Europe, Eastern sheet, published by UNESCO (see Selected References no.4). Specific details of the data sources are given in the metadata file on this CD-ROM. Map units were combined to simplify the map when projected at a larger scale and to maintain consistency with other region maps. Precambrian rocks are undivided and consist of sedimentary, metamorphic, and igneous types. The boundary for Region 2 (Middle East/North Africa) is shown as an inset on the map. Oil and gas field markers represent field centerpoints published with permission from Petroconsultants International Data Corp., 1996 database. Each region was divided into geologic provinces. Geologic province boundaries for the Arabian Peninsula were delineated onshore using data from the U.S. Geological Survey--Arabian American Oil Company, and UNESCO geologic maps (see Selected References), and other tectonic and geographical data from the publications listed in the Selected References section. Offshore geologic province boundaries are defined by the 2000 meter bathymetric contour from the U.S. Geologic Survey--Arabian American Oil Company 1963 geologic map (see Selected References). Provinces may contain one dominant element or a number of contiguous elements or basins that are genetically related. Each geologic province was assigned a unique number; the first digit is the region number. An attempt was made to number the provinces in geographical order. In the Arabian Peninsula the numbering starts in the southernmost portion of the peninsula, generally increasing to the east and north. This map was compiled and displayed using Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc. (ESRI) Arc/Info, ARCVIEW, and ArcPlot softwares. Political boundaries and their cartographic representation on this map were taken with permission from ESRI's ArcWorld 1:3,000,000 Arc/Info digital coverage, have no political significance, and are displayed as general reference only.

The information encoded about these features includes classification and other characteristics, delineation, geographic name, position and related measures, a "reach code" through which other information can be related to the NHD, and the direction of water flow. The network of reach codes delineating water and transported material flow allows users to trace movement in upstream and downstream directions. In addition to this geographic information, the dataset contains metadata that supports the exchange of future updates and improvements to the data. The NHD is available nationwide in two seamless datasets, one based on 1:24,000-scale maps and referred to as high resolution NHD, and the other based on 1:100,000-scale maps and referred to as medium resolution NHD. Additional selected areas in the United States are available based on larger scales, such as 1:5,000-scale or greater, and referred to as local resolution NHD. The NHD from The National Map supports many applications, such as making maps, geocoding observations, flow modeling, data maintenance, and stewardship. For additional information on NHD, go to nhd.usgs.gov. The Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) is a companion dataset to the NHD. It defines the perimeter of drainage areas formed by the terrain and other landscape characteristics. The drainage areas are nested within each other so that a large drainage area, such as the Upper Mississippi River, will be composed of multiple smaller drainage areas, such as the Wisconsin River. Each of these smaller areas can further be subdivided into smaller and smaller drainage areas. The WBD uses six different levels in this hierarchy, with the smallest averaging about 30,000 acres. The WBD is made up of polygons nested into six levels of data respectively defined by Regions, Subregions, Basins, Subbasins, Watersheds, and Subwatersheds.Description of research program for immediate and long-term management of grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis) inhabiting the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.

NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Branch, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Ron Brown, as well as federal, university, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data off the Atlantic Coast of Florida from 10/26/2010 to 10/27/2010. Data was acquired with a hull-mounted Kongsberg EM 710 multibeam echosounder (70 kHz). It was processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS software. Attitude and sound velocity correctors applied to the data. Verified tides were not applied to the data, leaving the depth values referenced to the ellipsoid. The imagery is projected in the UTM Zone 17 north, NAD83 datum. The processed CARIS data was used to generate a CARIS BASE surface based on swath angle. The CARIS Export option "BASE Surface to Image" was then used to create a GeoTiff of the priority areas.This map displays optical validation observation locations and percent coverage of scleractinian coral overlaid on bathymetry.Palmyra Atoll in the tropical Pacific is a "living laboratory" for multi-disciplinary research on coral reef ecosystems, insular terrestrial ecosystems, climate change, and the lingering effects of Cold War nuclear testing.An aerial photograph is a photograph of the earth's surface taken with a camera mounted in an airplane.

Photos and/or video were collected between 02/22/2004 and 03/01/2004 along 1 transect north of St. Croix and along 6 transects south of St. Thomas and St. John in the U.S. Virgin Islands. These photos and videos will be manually classified into different habitat classes, and integrated with the abiotic data collected by the acoustic sonar (sound navigation and ranging) systems to develop a benthic habitat map for the U.S. Caribbean. Habitat maps describe the location of habitat features (in relation to the shoreline), their physical composition and the types of organisms that colonize them. Fundamentally, habitat maps provide critical information about the extent, health and composition of marine resources, which is vital for communicating information about the distribution and abundance of species to resource managers, sci entists and the public. Habitat maps also support an increasing number of landscape ecology studies, as well as the process of marine spatial planning, including the design and evaluation of marine protected areas (MPAs).The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

Special district governments exist to provide only one or a limited number ofdesignated functions, and with sufficient administrative and fiscal autonomy to qualify as separate governments. Iowa townships today provide governmental functions that are outside the realm of both county and municipal authority. The three main functions of Iowa townships are fire protection, cemetery management, and fence maintenance and boundary dispute resolution within the township. The TIGER/Line Files are shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) that are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. County subdivisions are the primary divisions of counties and their equivalent entities for the reporting of Census Bureau data, and they include legally minor civil divisions (MCDs) and statistical census county divisions (CCDs), and unorganized territories. For the 2010 Census, the legal MCDs are the primary governmental and/or administrative divisions of counties in 29 States and Puerto Rico; Tennessee changed from having CCDs for Census 2000 to having MCDs for the 2010 Census. In MCD States where no MCD exists or is not defined, the Census Bureau creates statistical unorganized territories to complete coverage. The entire area of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas is covered by county subdivisions. The boundaries of all 2010 Census legal MCDs are as of January 1, 2010 as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS). For the 2010 Census, CCDs or their equivalents are delineated in 21 States. The boundaries of all 2010 Census statistical CCDs were delineated as part of the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP).This data set contains imagery from the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP). The NAIP acquires digital ortho imagery during the agricultural growing seasons in the continental U.S.. A primary goal of the NAIP program is to enable availability of ortho imagery within one year of acquisition. The NAIP provides two main products: 1 meter ground sample distance (GSD) ortho imagery rectified to a horizontal accuracy within +/- 5 meters of reference digital ortho quarter quads (DOQQ's) from the National Digital Ortho Program (NDOP) or from the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP); 1 meter GSD ortho imagery rectified within +/- 6 meters to true ground. The tiling format of NAIP imagery is based on a 3.75' x 3.75' quarter quadrangle with a 300 meter buffer on all four sides. The NAIP imagery is formatted to the UTM coordinate system using the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). The NAIP imagery may contain as much as 10% cloud cover per tile. The quarter quads have been reprojected from UTM 11 or UTM 12 to IDTM83 projection (ESPG 102605), mosaicked into 100k tiles, and compressed using ERDAS Imagine for use in ArcGIS.The once-a-decade decennial census was conducted in April 2010 by the U.S. Census Bureau. This count of every resident in the United States was mandated by Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution and all households in the U.S. and individuals living in group quarters were required by law to respond to the 2010 Census questionnaire. The data collected by the decennial census determine the number of seats each state has in the U.S. House of Representatives and is also used to distribute billions in federal funds to local communities. The questionnaire consisted of a limited number of questions but allowed for the collection of information on the number of people in the household and their relationship to the householder, an individual's age, sex, race and Hispanic ethnicity, the number of housing units and whether those units are owner- or renter-occupied, or vacant. The first wave of results for sub-state geographic areas in New Mexico was released on March 15, 2011, through the Redistricting Data (PL94-171) Summary File. This batch of data covers the state, counties, places (both incorporated and unincorporated communities), tribal lands, school districts, neighborhoods (census tracts and block groups), individual census blocks, and other areas. The Redistricting products provide counts by race and Hispanic ethnicity for the total population and the population 18 years and over, and housing unit counts by occupancy status. The 2010 Census Redistricting Data Summary File can be used to redraw federal, state and local legislative districts under Public Law 94-171. This is an important purpose of the file and, indeed, state officials use the Redistricting Data to realign congressional and state legislative districts in their states, taking into account population shifts since the 2000 Census. More detailed population and housing characteristics will be released in the summer of 2011. The data in these particular RGIS Clearinghouse tables are for all Block Groups in Eddy County. There are two data tables. One provides total counts by major race groups and by Hispanic ethnicity, while the other provides proportions of the total population for these same groups. These files, along with file-specific descriptions (in Word and text formats) are available in a single zip file.LiDAR was collected within portions of Pinellas, Hillsborough, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte, Lee, Collier, Monroe, and a very small coastal area of Pasco, Counties. System Parameters/Flight Plan: The LiDAR system acquisition parameters were developed based on a maximum average ground sample distance of 4 feet. Two Leica ALS50 sensors were used for acquisition. Acquisition specifications for the two sensors were as follows: Sensor 19 Field of View (full angle) - 29 degrees Nominal flight altitude (AMSL) - 3999.30 feet Airspeed - 54.02 meters/sec Laser pulse rate - 75,000 Hz Nominal swath width (on ground) - 2068.58 feet Maximum cross track point spacing - 3.91 feet Maximum along track point spacing - 3.94 feet Average point spacing - 2.21 feet Flight line spacing - 1544.95 feet Side overlap - 25.31 percent Sensor 59 Field of View (full angle) - 29 degrees Nominal flight altitude (AMSL) - 3999.30 feet Airspeed - 60.70 meters/sec Laser pulse rate - 84,400 Hz Nominal swath width (on ground) - 2068.58 feet Maximum cross track point spacing - 3.94 feet Maximum along track point spacing - 3.91 feet Average point spacing - 2.21 feet Flight line spacing - 1413.72 feet Side overlap - 31.66 percent. LiDAR System Calibration: Prior to the LiDAR acquisition, the system underwent a calibration to verify the operational accuracy and misalignment angles. Boresight calibrations were performed for each LiDAR system at the beginning and end of each flight mission. LiDAR Data Acquisition: LiDAR data acquisition only occurred when the sky was sufficiently clear of clouds, smoke, and atmospheric haze. The LiDAR data was processed immediately after the acquisition to verify the coverage had no voids. GPS/Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) Post Processing: The GPS and IMU data was post processed using differential and Kalman filter algorithms to derive a best estimate of trajectory. The quality of the solution was verified to be consistent with the accuracy requirements of the project. LiDAR Processing and Classification: The LiDAR data was post processed and verified to be consistent with the project requirements in terms of post spacing and absence of artifacts. The point cloud underwent classification to determine bare-earth points (class 2), noise points (class 7), water returns (class 9), and unclassified data (class 1). Class 12 contains LiDAR points removed from the overlap region between adjacent flight lines. The MASSPOINT feature class contains ground (class 2) points only. To create the MASSPOINT feature class, Ground (class 2) LAS points were extracted in ArcMap, using a Woolpert Team-developed VB script, and loaded into the Geodatabase as multipoint geometry.Using a geology-based assessment methodology, we estimated a total of 1.32 trillion barrels of oil in place in eighteen oil shale zones in this Eocene geologic unit.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

This center collects and stores samples of the sea bottom and subbottom from all over the world and makes them available to any person or institution interested in their study. A French national scientific commission defined the rules for collecting operating and using this facility. The commission consists of the representatives of the Ministry of Industry, industrial and oil firms, the main sea ports and Universities as well as of BRGM and CNEXO, which preside in turn every two years over the commission.BRGM is in charge of the management of the Center. Not only geological samples but also related data are stored such as geographical location, depth, weight and number or level, related studies, if any, etc. (the list of published studies is included). The samples and related data are identified by computer cards and are stored in computer files. After verification they are transferred to a data bank which integrates information from the lithotheque, phototheque and data collections for more complete processing. Institutions and persons interested in the cores may request the catalog of the already processed samples or may receive portions of samples for study following approval by the Commission. A copy of the lithotheque was transmitted to the World Data Center for Marine Geology and Geophysics, Boulder for distribution in 1985. More current information is available from BRGM. The data at the WDC (NGDC) include descriptions of approximately 25,000 samples.We estimated in-place resources of 1.07 trillion short tons of coal in this area using a geology-based assessment methodology. Of that total, recoverable coal was 162 billion tons, 25 billion economically recoverable.This dataset contains point features representing the approximate location of tax parcels contained in County Assessor tax rolls. Individual county data was integrated into this statewide publication by the Arkansas Geographic Information Office (AGIO). The Computer Aided Mass Appraisal (CAMA) systems maintained in each county are used to populate the database attributes for each centroid feature. The entity attribute structure conforms to the Arkansas Cadastral Mapping Standard. The digital cadastral data is provided as a publication version that only represents a snapshot of the production data at the time it was received from the county. Published updates may be made to counties throughout the year. These will occur after new data is digitized or updates to existing data are finished. Production versions of the data exist in the various counties where daily and weekly updates occur. Users should consult the BEGIN_DATE attribute column to determine the age of the data for a given county. This column reflects the date when AGIO received the data from the county. Only parcels with an associated Computer Assisted Mass Appraisal (CAMA) record are provided. This means a CAMA record may exist, but no point geometry or vice-versa. Cadastral data is dynamic by its nature; therefore it is impossible for any county to ever be considered complete. The data is NOT topologically enforced. As a statewide integrator, AGIO publishes the data but does not make judgment calls about where points or polygon lines are meant to be located. Therefore each county data set is published without topology rules being enforced. GIS Technicians use best practices such as polygon closure and vertex snapping, however, topology is not built for each county. Users should be aware, by Arkansas Law (15-21-504 2 B) digital cadastral data does not represent legal property boundary descriptions, nor is it suitable for boundary determination of the individual parcels included in the cadastre. Users requiring a boundary determination should consult an Arkansas Registered Land Surveyor (http://www.arkansas.gov/pels/search/search.php) on boundary questions. The digital cadastral data is intended to be a graphical representation of the tax parcel only. Just because a county is listed does NOT imply the data represents county wide coverage. AGIO worked with each county to determine a level of production that warranted the data was ready to be published. For example, in some counties only the north part of the county was covered or in other cases only rural parcels are covered and yet in others only urban parcels. The approach is to begin incremental publishing as production blocks are ready, even though a county may not have county wide coverage. Each case represents a significant amount of data that will be useful immediately. Users should consult the BEGIN_DATE attribute column to determine the age of the data for a given county. This date reflects when the data was received from the county. Digital cadastral data users should be aware the County Assessor Mapping Program adopted a phased approach for developing cadastral data. Phase One includes the production of a parcel centroid for each parcel that bears the attributes prescribed by the state cadastral mapping standard. Phase Two includes the production of parcel polygon geometry and bears the standard attributes. The Arkansas standard closely mirrors the federal Cadastral Core Data Standard established by the Federal Geographic Data Committee, Subcommittee for Cadastral Data.

The data were collected between October 2009 and August 2011. This collection was a joint effort by the NOAA Coastal Services Center (CSC); the California State Coastal Conservancy (SCC) Ocean Protection Council (OPC); Scripps Institution of Oceanography; and the Joint Airborne Lidar Bathymetry Technical Center of Expertise (JALBTCX). The data coverage extends landward 500 m from the shoreline, along the entire California coastline. The LAS classifications are as follows: 1-Unclassified, 2-Ground, 7-Noise, 9-Water, 10- Mudflats, 12-Overlap. The LAS points were manually re-classified from water and unclassified to ground in offshore areas where necessary.Bathymetric LiDAR: The bathymetric lidar data used in this merged project was 2009-2010 U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Joint Airborne Lidar Bathymetry Center of Expertise (JALBTCX) lidar, provided by JALBTCX. The data were collected for the California Coastal Mapping Project (CCMP). The original data were in ASCII format and were converted to LAS v1.2. The LAS data were classified as follows: 21-Non-submerged Bathymetry, 22-Bathymetry, 23-Ignored Submerged Bathymetry/Overlap.Multibeam Acoustic Data: The acoustic data data used in this merged project were provided by the California Seafloor Mapping Program (CSMP) Ocean Protection Council and NOAA's National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC). The original data were in ASCII format and were converted to LAS v1.2. NOAA's VDatum software was used to vertically transform soundings from mean lower low water (MLLW) tidal datum to NAVD88 orthometric datum where necessary. The LAS data were classified as follows: 25-Submerged Acoustic, 26-Ignored Submerged Acoustic/Overlap.Upon receipt of the data, the NOAA Coastal Services Center (CSC) converted some of the classifications for data storage and Digital Coast provisioning purposes. The following are the classifications of data available from the NOAA Digital Coast: 1 - Unclassified, 2 - Ground, 7 - Low point (noise), 9 - Water, 11 - Bathymetry, 12 - Overlap, 13 - Submerged Acoustic, 14 - Non-Submerged Bathymetry, 15 - Ignored Submerged Bathymetry/Overlap, 16 - Ignored Submerged Acoustic/OverlapDepartment of Economics - University of OxfordThis map displays optical validation observation locations and percent coverage of scleractinian coral overlaid on bathymetry.GEOTRACES, An International Study of Marine Biogeochemical Cycles of Trace Elements and their IsotopesThis data set consists of land derived from high resolution imagery and was analyzed according to the Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) protocol to determine land cover. This data set utilized 48 full or partial WorldView2 multispectral scenes and the 2005 high-resolution Oahu C-CAP data set. The imagery and base classification were included in a multi-step semi-automated change detection process to extract land cover features in the 2011 imagery.N/AMarkMail Email Search Search through email archives at MarkMailThree consecutive tows of an epibenthic sled fitted with a 365-micron mesh net were used to collect small (1-20 mm) motile animals from just above the bottom of two estuarine tidal creek stations (designated BB and DD) every two weeks at the midday low tide in the North Inlet Estuary, SC. Since previous field studies indicated that stage of tide and time of day affected organism abundance in the epibenthic sled stations, it was necessary to make collections about every 14 days when the same tide stage occurs at the same time of day to keep these variables "constant". Thus, three sequential tows (known as replicates A, B, and C) were made with the same apparatus with the direction of the ebbing current along the same tow path when the end of the ebbing tide occurred near noon. Collections from 1981 through 1984 at a sandy inlet (DD) and a major marsh creek (BB) location allowed for a comparison of two habitat types. Beginning in 1985, only the BB site continued its biweekly triplicate sampling. The same gear, field deployment, and tow path have been used since sample number one, made on January 20, 1981. Physical data including air temperature, surface and bottom water temperature and salinity, dissolved oxygen, and water velocity and light penetration from the waters surface to the bottom at 50 cm intervals were recorded just before the epibenthic collections. These parameters are listed in the EpiPhysicals81-2003 digital file. Pericarid crustaceans (i.e. mysids, amphipods), chaetognaths, hydromedusae, larval shrimps, crabs, and fishes dominated the epibenthic catches. From 1981 through 1984 all organisms were identified under a microscope to species or lowest possible taxa for both sampling sites, BB and DD; larval fish species were measured and counted, and shrimp life stages were noted and counted. Beginning in 1985 with sample 100, the taxa categories counted were merged into fewer categories in order to speed up processing. Samples with a great number of organisms were split before taxa categories were counted. Counts were adjusted by the number of times the sample was split, and then converted to numbers per cubic meter of water filtered before average numbers per sample were calculated.This set of PDF graphic files represents the Minnesota Department of Transportation's County Highway Map Series. The origin of this data is Mn/DOT's Microstation CAD system, where all linework, feature type coding, and symbolization is stored and updated. To produce these graphic files, Mn/DOT exported the data from Microstation into postscript files. LMIC then imported the data into Adobe Acrobat Distiller to create the PDF files. Areal extents of the files mirror the paper maps distributed by Mn/DOT: single maps for small counties, multiple map sheets for larger counties. These files are static and represent the Mn/DOT County Highway Map as of January 1, 2002.A group of known and/or postulated sub-seafloor pools (hydrocarbon accumulations) that share common geologic, geographic, and temporal properties, such as history of hydrocarbon generation, migration, reservoir development, and entrapment.

The analysis was based on seismic surveys analyzed by BOEM geologists.Research findings and examples of application to real problems--how household contaminants accumulate in and effect the environmentThese reports provide the results of nine years (1990-98) of an annual quantitative monitoring of shallow marine communities inshore of the Sand Island Ocean Outfall, Oahu, Hawaii. This monitoring effort focuses on benthic and fish community structure and is designed to detect changes in these communities. Marine communities offshore of Honolulu have received considerable perturbation over the last 100 years. Dumping of raw sewage in shallow water, which occurred from 1955 to 1977, was halted in 1978; however, point and nonpoint sources of pollution from both urban activities and industry continue. All of these disturbances may serve to obscure any impacts that may be caused by treated effluent discharged from the deep-ocean outfall. The marine communities show a considerable range in development that is probably related to historical impacts. Stations have been located to take advantage of these gradients. Analysis of the nine years of data showed that there has been no statistically significant change in any of the biological parameters measured in this study other than for the mean number of invertebrate species and numbers of individual invertebrates encountered per transect. In these cases the data for 1998 showed significantly greater numbers of species and individuals over other years. These changes are probably the result of higher than usual counts of the Christmas tree worm Spirobranchus giganteus corniculatus, as well as just more invertebrate species present at most stations.Gridded multibeam bathymetry is integrated with gridded LiDAR bathymetry and bathymetry derived from multispectral IKONOS satellite data. Gridded (5 m cell size) multibeam bathymetry collected aboard NOAA Ship Hiialaka'i and R/V AHI. LiDAR/multibeam bathymetry mosiac provided by the U.S. Navy through PIBHMC. Bathymetry values shallower than 25 m were derived by gauging the relative attenuation of blue and green spectral radiance as a function of depth (as gauged by LiDAR data). A multiple linear regression analysis of linearized blue and green band spectral values against depth determined the variables of y-intercept, blue slope and green slope values. Variables then used in multivariate slope intercept formula to derive depth. Variables were adjusted to improve the statistical accuracy and spatial coverage of the final derived bathymetry product. Digital image processing to derive depths conducted with the ENVI 4.5 software program while data editing and integration was performed using ArcGIS 9.3.

Two bottom trawl surveys are conducted each year, one in the spring and one in the autumn. The survey is a standardized, stratified random design, with stratification based on bathymetry and multiple trawl sites within each stratum. Trawl sites are selected randomly, but the overall ship path is south to north. The survey covers the continental shelf and U.S. exclusive economic zone (EEZ) from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina into the Canadian EEZ. The primary gear is a bottom trawl, with CTD, multifrequency echosounder, and a host of other scientific sensor data collected ancillary to the bottom trawl catches. The last three legs of this cruise have EK60 data that are only collected to 50 m depth and are not archived at NGDC.This program encompasses regional studies of ground water systems, multidisciplinary studies of critical ground water issues, access to ground-water data, and research and methods development.TechDoc SSCTDPUB Search ProviderTIGER, TIGER/Line, and Census TIGER are registered trademarks of the Bureau of the Census.

The Redistricting Census 2000 TIGER/Line data dictionary contains a complete list of all the fields in the 17 record types.U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Employment Website has the information needed to find a job with the USGS.Explains how to use this command-line software to estimate peak flood discharge using indirect measures such as high water marks on trees or buildings.The east side of the northern Alaska Peninsula near Puale Bay and the Iniskin Peninsula of Lower Cook Inlet have long held interest to exploration geologists due to their well developed oil and gas seeps, which spurred on the first active exploration and drilling efforts for petroleum in Alaska. Several oil rushes occurred in the early part of 20th century, primarily in two phases (1902-1905 and 1922-1926) in the area of Puale Bay and Becharof Lake. Unfortunately all of these wells produced only traces of hydrocarbons. Several subsequent deeper wells were drilled in Mesozoic strata of this region and nearby Wide Bay to the south, but like the earlier efforts, did not prove to be economical. Each oil and gas seep from this region is plotted on the map accompanying this report and their coordinates are listed in a table. Original published information concerning the seeps is reproduced. In addition, a single prominent solid hydrocarbon locality cited in the early literature is also discussed. Geochemical data is given for some of the seeps.WMSHydrologic landscape regions (HLRs) in the United States were delineated by using geographic information system (GIS) tools and statistical methods including principal components and cluster analyses. The GIS and statistical analyses were applied to land-surface form, geologic texture (permeability of the soil and bedrock), and climate variables that describe the physical and climatic setting of 43,931 small (roughly 200 square kilometers) watersheds in the United States. The analyses then grouped the watersheds into 20 noncontiguous regions (the HLRs) on the basis of similarities in land-surface form, geologic texture, and climate characteristics. This hydrologic landscape regions dataset contains for each of the 43,931 watersheds the (1) watershed identification number, (2) land-surface form, geologic texture, and climate characteristics for each watershed, and (3) hydrologic landscape region number for each watershed.Overview of aspects of research on pesticides and herbicides in Midwestern rivers with collection of data, results over a period of time, online publications, and bibliography.The 1/3-second Guam Elevation Grid provides bathymetric data in ASCII raster format of 1/3-second resolution in geographic coordinates.

Hydrographic survey data primarily consist of water depths, but may also include features (e.g. rocks, wrecks), navigation aids, shoreline identification, and bottom type information. NOAA is responsible for archiving and distributing the source data as described in this metadata record.Explains and shows data and expertise we were able to provide to Federal agencies and decision makers to help them deal with this difficult situation.The TIGER/Line shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or equivalent entity, and were defined by local participants as part of the 2010 Census Participant Statistical Areas Program. The Census Bureau delineated the census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where all the potential participants declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of census data and comparison back to previous decennial censuses. Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. When first delineated, census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new development, and so forth, may require boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth, or combined as a result of substantial population decline. Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features. They may follow legal boundaries such as minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries in some States and situations to allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses. State and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard census geographic hierarchy. In a few rare instances, a census tract may consist of noncontiguous areas. These noncontiguous areas may occur where the census tracts are coextensive with all or parts of legal entities that are themselves noncontiguous. For the 2010 Census, the census tract code range of 9400 through 9499 was enforced for census tracts that include a majority American Indian population according to Census 2000 data and/or their area was primarily covered by federally recognized American Indian reservations and/or off-reservation trust lands; the code range 9800 through 9899 was enforced for those census tracts that contained little or no population and represented a relatively large special land use area such as a National Park, military installation, or a business/industrial park; and the code range 9900 through 9998 was enforced for those census tracts that contained only water area, no land area.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

The National Flood Hazard Layer (NFHL) data incorporates all Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map(DFIRM) databases published by FEMA, and any Letters Of Map Revision (LOMRs) that have been issued against those databases since their publication date. The DFIRM Database is the digital, geospatial version of the flood hazard information shown on the published paper Flood Insurance Rate Maps(FIRMs). The primary risk classifications used are the 1-percent-annual-chance flood event, the 0.2-percent-annual-chance flood event, and areas of minimal flood risk. The NFHL data are derived from Flood Insurance Studies (FISs), previously published Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), flood hazard analyses performed in support of the FISs and FIRMs, and new mapping data where available. The FISs and FIRMs are published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The specifications for the horizontal control of DFIRM data are consistent with those required for mapping at a scale of 1:12,000. The NFHL data contain layers in the Standard DFIRM datasets except for S_Label_Pt and S_Label_Ld. The NFHL is available as State or US Territory data sets. Each State or Territory data set consists of all DFIRMs and corresponding LOMRs available on the publication date of the data set.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

Raw survey data included species level abundance estimates.The American Community Survey (ACS) is a nationwide survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau that is designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing. It is a critical element in the Census Bureau's reengineered decennial census program, incorporating the detailed socioeconomic and housing questions that were previously asked on the decennial census long form into the ACS questionnaire. The ACS now collects and produces this detailed population and housing information every year instead of every ten years. Data are collected on an on-going basis throughout the year and are released each year for large geographic areas, those with 65,000 persons or more. However, sample sizes are not large enough for annual releases that cover smaller areas, those with less than 65,000 persons. Data that are suitable for areas with 20,000 to 65,000 persons are accumulated over three years and termed a three-year period estimate, the first of which was for the 2005-2007 period. Data that are suitable for areas with less than 20,000 persons are accumulated over five years and termed a five-year period estimate, the first of which was for the 2005-2009 period. The data in this series of RGIS Clearinghouse tables are for all New Mexico counties and are based on the 2005-2009 ACS Five-Year Period Estimates collected between January 2005 and December 2009. These data tables are a summary of all major economic topics published through the ACS, providing statistics on employment status, commuting to work, occupation, industry, class of worker, household income distributions, household income by type, family income distributions, nonfamily household income, incomes of individuals, and family and person poverty rates. Percentages are shown along with numeric estimates for most data items. Because the data are based on a sample the Census Bureau also provides information about the magnitude of sampling error. Consequently, the estimated margin of error (MOE) is shown next to each data item. Each economic topic is covered in a separate file in both Excel and CSV formats. These files, along with file-specific descriptions (in Word and text formats) are available in a single zip file.This part of DS 781 presents data for folds for the geologic and geomorphic map of the Offshore of Pacifica map area, California. The vector data file is included in "Folds_OffshorePacifica.zip," which is accessible from http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/781/OffshorePacifica/data_catalog_OffshorePacifica.html. The Offshore of Pacifica map area straddles the right-lateral transform boundary between the North American and Pacific plates and is cut by several active faults that cumulatively form a distributed shear zone, including the San Andreas Fault, the eastern strand of the San Gregorio Fault, the Golden Gate Fault, and the Potato Patch Fault (sheets 8, 9; Bruns and others, 2002; Ryan and others, 2008). These faults are covered by Holocene sediments (mostly units Qms, Qmsb, Qmst) with no seafloor expression, and are mapped using seismic-reflection data (sheet 8). The San Andreas Fault is the primary plate-boundary structure and extends northwest across the map area; it intersects the shoreline 10 km north of the map area at Pacifica Lagoon, and 3 km south of the map area at Mussel Rock. This section of the San Andreas Fault has an estimated slip rate of 17 to 24 mm/yr (U.S. Geological Survey, 2010), and the devastating Great 1906 California earthquake (M 7.8) is thought to have nucleated on the San Andreas a few kilometers offshore of San Francisco within the map area (sheet 9; Bolt, 1968; Lomax, 2005). The San Andreas Fault forms the boundary between two distinct basement terranes, Upper Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous rocks of the Franciscan Complex to the east, and Late Cretaceous granitic and older metamorphic rocks of the Salinian block to the west. Franciscan Complex rocks (unit KJf, undivided) form seafloor outcrops at and north of Point Lobos adjacent to onland exposures. The Franciscan is divided into 13 different units for the onshore portion of this geologic map based on different lithologies and ages, but the unit cannot be similarly divided in the offshore because of a lack of direct observation and (or) sampling. Folds were primarily mapped by interpretation of seismic reflection profile data (see S-15-10-NC and F-2-07-NC). The seismic reflection profiles were collected between 2007 and 2010.

Dozens of atmospheric and land-soil variables are available through this dataset, from temperatures, winds, and precipitation to soil moisture and atmospheric ozone concentration. The entire globe is covered by the GFS at a base horizontal resolution of 18 miles (28 kilometers) between grid points, which is used by the operational forecasters who predict weather out to 16 days in the future. Horizontal resolution drops to 44 miles (70 kilometers) between grid point for forecasts between one week and two weeks. The GFS model is a coupled model, composed of four separate models (an atmosphere model, an ocean model, a land/soil model, and a sea ice model), which work together to provide an accurate picture of weather conditions. Changes are regularly made to the GFS model to improve its performance and forecast accuracy. This dataset is run four times daily at 00z, 06z, 12z and 18z out to 192 hours with a 0.5 degree horizontal resolution and a 3 hour temporal resolution.USGS high resolution orthorectified images from The National Map combine the image characteristics of an aerial photograph with the geometric qualities of a map. An orthoimage is a uniform-scale image where corrections have been made for feature displacement such as building tilt and for scale variations caused by terrain relief, sensor geometry, and camera tilt. A mathematical equation based on ground control points, sensor calibration information, and a digital elevation model is applied to each pixel to rectify the image to obtain the geometric qualities of a map. A digital orthoimage may be created from several photographs mosaicked to form the final image. The source imagery may be black-and-white, natural color, color infrared, or color near infrared (4-band) with a pixel resolution of 1-meter or finer. With orthoimagery, the resolution refers to the distance on the ground represented by each pixel.WMSThe USGS Imagery Topo Large service from The National Map (TNM) is a dynamic topographic base map service that combines the best available data (Boundaries, Elevation, Geographic Names, Hydrography, Land Cover, Structures, and Transportation with Orthoimagery) that make up The National Map. Contours generated for the US Topo product are visible along with other data at scales of 1:13,500 and larger. This product is designed to provide a seamless view of the data in a geographic information system (GIS) accessible format, closely resembling The National Map US Topo GeoPDF product at large scales.Trace elements are inorganic chemicals occurring in small amounts in nature.

Biological samples were collected from Atlantic bluefin tuna landed by the commercial and recreational fisheries in New England. Due to the timing of this award, the authors used these funds to sample Atlantic bluefin tuna from 1 Sept 2011 to 8 Oct 2011 and through the 2012 bluefin commercial season, 1 Jun to 7 Nov 2012. They combined fish sampled from this award with samples collected from the two previous years, projects supported by other funding sources. The total number of fish sampled has increased year to year with a total of 334, 493 and 692 fish sampled for years 2010, 2011, and 2012 respectively. Since the timing of the award was out of phase with the bluefin tuna sampling season, researchers conducted age and growth analysis on samples previously collected in 2010 and 2011. This research project sought to collect representative biological samples from juvenile and adult bluefin tuna to support age and growth analysis as well as reproductive status for integration into stock assessment for western Atlantic bluefin tuna.N/AThe majority of this dataset is data generated as part of a CCW funded PhD for the University of Wales Swansea by Lucy Smith known as Carmarthen Bay infauna scoter project.

It provides access to datasets from state and federal agencies as well as educational and research institutions. OBIS-USA handles both specimen-based data and survey results. Survey data come from recovered archives and current research activities. The datasets document where and when species were observed or collected, bringing together marine biogeographic data that are spatially, taxonomically, and temporally comprehensive. The public OBIS-USA site (http://www.usgs.gov/obis-usa) provides actual data contents as well as summary data about what is contained in each dataset to assist users in evaluating suitability for use. Current functionality allows the user to locate, view, and aggregate the datasets and FGDC compliant metadata as well as to view and search the taxonomic, geographic, and temporal extent. To promote data interoperability, the data are available in accordance with the marine-focused implementation of the Darwin Core data standard. In addition to basic download functions (tab-delimited), OBIS-USA offers web services for query flexibility and a wide range of output formats, such as kml, NetCDF, MATLAB, json, and graph or map output, to enable diverse types of scientific and geospatial data use and analysis platforms and products. OBIS-USA's two web services (ERDDAP and GeoServer) enable integration of OBIS-USA biogeographic data with other data types, such as seafloor geology, physical oceanography, water chemistry, and climate data. The NOAA Environmental Research Division Data Access Program(ERRDDAP) enables users to query scientific data by flexible parameters and obtain output in many formats. Access can be found at http://www1.usgs.gov/erddap/tabledap/AllMBG.html . OBIS-USA uses the tabledap component of ERDDAP to access Darwin-Core-type tabular spatial data; tabledap is a superset of the OPeNDAP DAP constraint protocol. OBIS-USA offers an ESRI REST Service with access to Darwin-Core-type point data at http://gis1.usgs.gov/arcgis/rest/services/OBISUSA/OBIS_USA_All_Marine_Biogeographic_Records/MapServer/ and an OGC compliant Web Mapping Service (wms) http://gis1.usgs.gov/arcgis/services/OBISUSA/OBIS_USA_All_Marine_Biogeographic_Records/MapServer/WMSServer?request=GetCapabilities=WMS. OBIS-USA and collaborators are further deploying the Darwin Core standard to capture richer information, such as absence and abundance, observations on effort, individual tracking, and more advanced biogeography capabilities. Data are accepted into OBIS-USA from the data originator or holder, minimizing the burden on the participant. OBIS-USA works with data providers to understand the best process to transfer the data, review the data prior to their release, gather comprehensive metadata, and then allow public access to this information. Becoming part of the OBIS-USA network is intended to have tangible benefits for participants, for example, freeing the participant from responding to requests for data and alleviating security concerns since users do not directly access the participant's computers.This digitally compiled map includes geology, oil and gas field centerpoints, geologic provinces, and major faults of Iran with some of these components extended into geographically adjacent areas. This digital compilation is an interim product of the U.S. Geological Survey's World Energy Project (WEP) and part of a series on CD-ROM. The goal of the WEP is to assess the undiscovered, technically recoverable oil and gas resources of the world and report the result of this assessment in the year 2000. For data management purposes, the world was divided into eight energy regions corresponding approximately to the economic regions of the world as defined by the U.S. Department of State. Each world energy region was then further divided into geologic provinces on the basis of natural geologic entities and may include a dominant geologic structural element or a number of contiguous elements. Some provinces contain multiple, genetically-related basins. Geologic province boundaries for Iran were delineated using data from different geologic maps, publications, and other tectonic and geographic data. Each province was assigned a unique number; the first digit is the region number. An attempt was made to number the provinces in geographical order or groups with numbering starting at the Arabian Shield (see Pollastro and others, 1998). The list of provinces sorted by number is shown to the right of the map. Centerpoints of oil and gas fields are shown and were plotted with permission from Petroconsultants International Data Corporation, 1996 worldwide oil and gas field database. Allocation of field data to geologic provinces provided a ranking of the provinces by total known petroleum volume (see Klett and others, 1997). The WEP further characterizes the geologic provinces by petroleum system and assessment units in order to assess the undiscovered petroleum volume. Specific details of map and data sources, and the procedure used in the compilation of this geologic map of Iran are given in the metadata file and described briefly in the text below. Stratigraphic subdivisions of Phanerozoic rocks were combined to simplify the geology and maintain consistency with other maps in this series. Precambrian rocks are undivided. This map was compiled using Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc.(ESRI) ARC/INFO software. Political boundaries and cartographic representations are used, with permission, from ESRI's ArcWorld 1:3M digital coverages, have no political significance, and are displayed for general reference only.This dataset contains polygons and attributes which represent the voting precincts for the counties in the State of Arkansas. It includes the precinct name or number assigned by each County Election Commission following the redistricting process. The data was generated following the release of the 2010 Census data and was finalized in 2012. During the redistricting process a number of administrative boundaries were redrawn. The voting precincts include mulitpart polygons that are not contiguous in some counties. The compilation of this data is an effort of the Secretary of State to aid in election administration and future redistricting.This data set describes the potential threat of sediment delivery and land-based sources of pollution to benthic habitats. This dataset is derived from NOAA's study, the Benthic Habitats of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The Benthic Habitats data is the result of a cooperative effort between NOAA's National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS), U.S. Geological Survey, National Park Service, and the National Geophysical Data Center, to produce benthic habitat maps and georeferenced imagery for Puerto Rico.

The Census Bureau delineated the census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where all the potential participants declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of census data and comparison back to previous decennial censuses.

When first delineated, census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new development, and so forth, may require boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth, or combined as a result of substantial population decline. Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features. They may follow legal boundaries such as minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries in some States and situations to allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses. State and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard census geographic hierarchy. In a few rare instances, a census tract may consist of noncontiguous areas. These noncontiguous areas may occur where the census tracts are coextensive with all or parts of legal entities that are themselves noncontiguous. For the 2010 Census, the census tract code range of 9400 through 9499 was enforced for census tracts that include a majority American Indian population according to Census 2000 data and/or their area was primarily covered by federally recognized American Indian reservations and/or off-reservation trust lands; the code range 9800 through 9899 was enforced for those census tracts that contained little or no population and represented a relatively large special land use area such as a National Park, military installation, or a business/industrial park; and the code range 9900 through 9998 was enforced for those census tracts that contained only water area, no land area.Search -Highlights research studies involving genetics and genomics, includes a glossary of terms on the subject, a directory of scientists involved in this type of work, and description of research facilities through which USGS carries out genetic studiesWMSThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

An orthoimage is remotely sensed image data in which displacement of features in the image caused by terrain relief and sensor orientation have been mathematically removed. Orthoimagery combines the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map. Each orthoimage provides imagery over a 5000-foot by 5000-foot block on the ground. There is no image overlap between adjacent files. The projected coordinate system is Georgia State Plane West (FIPS 1002) feet with a NAD83 datum.Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI) maps are an integral component in oil-spill contingency planning and assessment. They serve as a source of information in the event of an oil spill incident. ESI maps contain three types of information: shoreline habitats (classified according to their sensitivity to oiling), sensitive biological resources, and human-use resources. Most often, this information is plotted on 7.5 minute USGS quadrangles, although in the Alaska ESI maps, USGS topographic maps at scales of 1:63,360 and 1:250,000 are used, and in other ESI maps, NOAA charts have been used as the base map. Collections of these maps, grouped by state or a logical geographic area, are published as ESI atlases. Digital data have been published for most of the U.S. shoreline, including Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.This image represents a 2 meter resolution backscatter mosaic of the bank and shelf south of St. John, US Virgin Islands.NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Team, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory, federal, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data in the US Virgin Islands from 3/28/2011 to 4/14/2011. Data was acquired with a hull-mounted Reson 7125 multibeam echosounder (400 kHz) and processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS software. Data has all correctors applied (attitude, sound velocity) and has been reduced to mean lower low water (MLLW) using final approved tides from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM zone 20 north, datum NAD83. The backscatter component of the bathymetry data were geometrically and radiometrically corrected using Hypack 2011 Geocoder software.

The CLIMAP 18k bp sediment data files were compiled by Oregon State University, and include the work of several major institutions. The files contain micropaleontology in the form of faunal counts of diatoms, planktonic foraminifera, coccoliths, and radiolaria, as well as stratigraphy (percent fine, coarse, total carbonate, oxygen 18 and carbon 13), and geochemistry (percent opal, quartz, and organic carbon), and inferred sea surface temperatures for 635 ocean sediment cores. Data are primarily from the period 18,000 years bp to the present. Time data give upper and lower samples depths, technique, and C14 dates (for total sample, coarse fraction, and fine fraction). Age estimates are given in thousands of years with upper and lower age error estimates. In addition, each data records contains station information. The CLIMAP 18k data set is available for direct download via the NGDC Web server.SCAR initiates, develops and coordinates scientific research in the Antarctic region and provides objective independent scientific advice to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings.This map displays optical validation observation locations and percent coverage of scleractinian coral overlaid on bathymetry.Search the Debian website.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

Each offshore area is defined by an API Number corresponding to those in the API Bulletin Number D12A. OPDs are numbered using the United Nations International Map of the World Numbering System, and are generally named for land or hydrographic features contained within the limits of the diagram. This data set contains Official Protraction Diagram (OPD) outlines in ESRI Arc/Info export and Arc/View shape file formats for the BOEM Gulf of Mexico Region. The use of OPDs makes it easier to refer to individual blocks within a region or planning area. These OPD diagrams were clipped along the Submerged Lands Act (SLA) boundary and along lines contained in the Continental Shelf Boundaries (CSB) GIS data files to show only those blocks or portions thereof within federal jurisdiction. Because GIS projection and topology functions can change or generalize coordinates, these GIS files are NOT an OFFICIAL record for the exact OPD boundaries. Only the paper OPD or a digital image of them serves as OFFICIAL records.Official Protraction Diagrams and other cadastre information the BOEM produces are generated in accordance with 30 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 256.8 to support Federal land ownership and mineral resource management.

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Block Groups (BGs) are defined before tabulation block delineation and numbering, but are clusters of blocks within the same census tract that have the same first digit of their 4-digit census block number from the same decennial census. For example, Census 2000 tabulation blocks 3001, 3002, 3003,.., 3999 within Census 2000 tract 1210.02 are also within BG 3 within that census tract. Census 2000 BGs generally contained between 600 and 3,000 people, with an optimum size of 1,500 people. Most BGs were delineated by local participants in the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP). The Census Bureau delineated BGs only where the PSAP participant declined to delineate BGs or where the Census Bureau could not identify any local PSAP participant. A BG usually covers a contiguous area. Each census tract contains at least one BG, and BGs are uniquely numbered within census tract. Within the standard census geographic hierarchy, BGs never cross county or census tract boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of other geographic entities like county subdivisions, places, urban areas, voting districts, congressional districts, and American Indian / Alaska Native / Native Hawaiian areas. BGs have a valid code range of 0 through 9. BGs coded 0 were intended to only include water area, no land area, and they are generally in territorial seas, coastal water, and Great Lakes water areas. For Census 2000, rather than extending a census tract boundary into the Great Lakes or out to the U.S. nautical three-mile limit, the Census Bureau delineated some census tract boundaries along the shoreline or just offshore. The Census Bureau assigned a default census tract number of 0 and BG of 0 to these offshore, water-only areas not included in regularly numbered census tract areas.This map layer contains a natural-earth image of the conterminous United States.

All users should individually evaluate the suitability of this data according to their own needs and standards.Critical habitat (CH) is designated for the survival and recovery of species listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Critical habitat includes those areas occupied by the species, on which are found physical and biological features that are essential to the conservation of an ESA listed species and which may require special management considerations or protection. Critical habitat may also include unoccupied habitat if the Secretary determines that the unoccupied habitat is essential for the conservation of the species. Critical habitat is designated by regulation at the time a species is listed under the ESA unless it is not prudent to do so or it is not determinable at the time. If it is not determinable, then NMFS must designate CH no later than one year after publication of a final listing. After identifying areas that meet the definition of CH, NMFS conducts an analysis to determine whether the economic, national security, or other relevant impacts of designating some areas as CH outweigh the benefits to the species. If so, NMFS may exclude such areas from the final CH designation. Each proposed and final regulation is published in the Federal Register. The final CH designation is also published in the Code of Federal Regulations (50 CFR 226).WMSThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

The program will also create a geographic information system (GIS) database for the parks under its management. The purpose of the data is to document the state of vegetation within the NPS service area during the 1990's, thereby providing a baseline study for further analysis at the Regional or Service-wide level. The vegetation units of this map were determined through stereoscopic interpretation of aerial photographs supported by field sampling and ecological analysis. The vegetation boundaries were identified on the photographs by means of the photographic signatures and collateral information on slope, hydrology, geography, and vegetation in accordance with the Standardized National Vegetation Classification System (October 1995). The mapped vegetation reflects conditions that existed during the specific year and season that the aerial photographs were taken (spring - 1996 and fall - 1994). There is an inherent margin of error in the use of aerial photography for vegetation delineation and classification.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

CHARTS integrates topographic and bathymetric lidar sensors, a digital camera and a hyperspectral scanner on a single remote sensing platform for use in coastal mapping and charting activities. Data coverage generally extends along the coastline from the waterline inland 500 meters (topography) and offshore 1,000 meters or to laser extinction (bathymetry). The topographic lidar sensor has a pulse repetition rate of 9 kHz at 1064 nm (near-infrared wavelength). The bathymetric lidar sensor has a pulse repetition rate of 1 kHz at 532 nm (green wavelength). Native lidar data is not generally in a format accessible to most Geographical Information Systems (GIS). Specialized in-house and commercial software packages are used to process the native lidar data into 3-dimensional positions that can be imported into GIS software for visualization and further analysis. Horizontal positions, provided in decimal degrees of latitude and longitude, are referenced to the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). Vertical positions were referenced to the NAD83 ellipsoid and provided in meters. The National Geodetic Survey's (NGS) GEOID03 model was used to transform the vertical positions from ellipsoid to orthometric heights referenced to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88). The positions are relative to NAD83 in decimal degrees of longitude and latitude. The heights were converted from ellipsoid to orthometric heights (NAVD88) using the Geoid03 model with the results in meters. Once converted to geoid heights, the data were then converted to IGLD85 using the VDatum program from NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration). The NOAA Coastal Services center received the data and converted the hydro files from IGLD85 heights to NAVD88 heights using VDatum. The heights were then converted to ellipsoid heights using Geoid03. The topo files were converted from NAVD88 heights to ellipsoid heights using Geoid03. These files were converted for data storage and Digital Coast provisioning purposes.The goal of this project is to quantify, at the National scale, the relative susceptibility of the Nation&amp;apos;s coast to sea- level rise through the use of a coastal vulnerability index (CVI).

The bedrock surface is buried by unconsolidated surficial sediments (mostly Quaternary) over most of its extent, but this surface coincides with the modern land surface in areas of bedrock exposure. The map is consistent with all available data including drill records and well samples, as well as surface bedrock exposures (both natural and man-made) and shallow-to-bedrock soils units (NRCS county soils maps). Mapped stratigraphic intervals are portrayed primarily at the group level (i.e., a grouping of bedrock formations), each characterized by distinctive lithologies (rock types) summarized in the map key and associated metadata. The distribution of bedrock units was mapped to conform to the current map of bedrock topography (elevation of the bedrock surface). The structural configurations of relevant stratigraphic datums were intercepted with the bedrock topographic surface to produce the map contacts. The line style shown on the bedrock geologic map qualitatively reflects both data density and degree of certainty of individual stratigraphic contacts.

Magnetometer: Varian magnetometerDigital Elevation Model (DEM) is a representation of the topography of the Earth surface in digital format. The data is made up of sampled arrays of pixels depicting surface elevations in raster form. This data was captured as an ancillary product of a statewide ortho image acquisition using a Lecia ADS40 sensor. The primary DEM is a 5-meter ground resolution, quarter-quadrangle (3.75 minutes of latitude by 3.75 minutes of longitude) cast on the Universal Transverse Mercator projection (UTM) on the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). The geographic extent of the DEM is equivalent to a quarter-quadrangle plus the over edge ranges from a minimum of 50 meters to a maximum of 300 meters beyond the extremes of the primary and secondary corner points. The over edge is included to facilitate for the placement of the NAD83 and secondary datum corner ticks. This series of DEM's was produced as a part of the 2006 Arkansas Digital Orthophotography Program administered by the Arkansas State Land Information Board and the Arkansas Geographic Information Office. The aerial imaging data used to create the DEM was acquired between January 15th and March 31st in 2006.powered by the HUBzero(R) Platform for Scientific CollaborationThis data set consists of six-inch pixel resolution, natural color orthoimages covering the urban area footprint.

NOAA Climate Normals are a large suite of data products that provide users with many tools to understand typical climate conditions for thousands of locations across the United States. As many NWS stations as possible are used, including those from the NWS Cooperative Observer Program (COOP) Network as well as some additional stations that have a Weather Bureau Army-Navy (WBAN) station identification number, including stations from the Climate Reference Network (CRN). The comprehensive U.S. Climate Normals dataset includes various derived products including daily air temperature normals (including maximum and minimum temperature normal, heating and cooling degree day normal, and others), precipitation normals (including snowfall and snow depth, percentiles, frequencies and other), and hourly normals (all normal derived from hourly data including temperature, dew point, heat index, wind chill, wind, cloudiness, heating and cooling degree hours, pressure normals). Users can access the data either by product or by station. Included in the dataset is extensive documentation to describe station metadata, filename descriptions, and methodology of producing the data. All data utilized in the computation of the 1981-2010 Climate Normals were taken from the ISD Lite (a subset of derived Integrated Surface Data), the Global Historical Climatology Network-Daily dataset, and standardized monthly temperature data (COOP). These source datasets (including intermediate datasets used in the computation of products) are also archived at the NOAA NCDC.Department of Economics - University of OxfordN/AIOC Photo LibraryTo support a long-term NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program (CRCP) for sustainable management and conservation of coral reef ecosystems, from 25 May - 09 June 2007, marine invertebrate quantitative assessments were conducted, as part of Rapid Ecological Assessments (REA), during the Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program (RAMP) Cruise HI0703 in the Marianas Archipelago. Such cruises are conducted at biennial intervals by the Coral Reef Ecosystem Division (CRED) at the NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC). At specific reef sites, marine invertebrate zoologists along with coral and algal biologists entered the water and conducted a fine-scale (~100 m2) and high degree of taxonomic resolution benthic REA survey for coral, algae, and key invertebrate species. Invertebrate surveys were focused on quantifying key non-coral invertebrate species common to the reef habitats, and were conducted using a combination of different survey techniques to quantify the diverse communities. These methods included belt-transect surveys, roving-swim surveys, and quadrat surveys. In belt-transect surveys, quantitative counts of key invertebrates were recorded along two consecutively-placed 25m long and 2m wide belt transects (total area = 100 m2). For any species that cannot be identified in the field, a photograph and a representative specimen, if possible, is collected for later identification. Roving-swim surveys were conducted in the general area with the goal to collect qualitative data for rare, larger, and cryptic organisms, such as Crown of Thorns Starfish and Triton's Trumpet snails which may not be seen during belt-transect surveys, and to survey any additional habitats present at the site, e.g. sand, sea grass, pavement, etc. This was accomplished by swimming a zig-zag pattern that extends roughly 5 m on either side of the two transect lines (total length = 500 m). Quadrat surveys were used to quantify the smaller, more cryptic invertebrates which were sometimes overlooked or too numerous to count during belt-transect surveys. Ten 0.25-m2 quadrats were laid out at 2-m intervals along two of the 25-m transects (total area = 5 m2). For each quadrat the percent cover of sponges, octocorals and zoanthids was recorded, as well as urchins, hermit crabs of the genus Calcinus, trapezid crabs, and coralliophilid snails. In addition, up to 25 cm diameters of all urchin species are measured. Based on data from previous REA surveys, a group of target invertebrate species was chosen for quantitative counts at 3 REA sites at Alamagan Island in the Marianas Archipelago. The species in the list were chosen because they have been shown to be common components of the reef habitats and they are species that are generally visible (i.e.; non-cryptic) and easily enumerated during the course of a single 50-60 minute SCUBA survey.This dataset includes flux data from the Shrub site near Ivotuk gathered during the 1998 summer field season. Surface energy and trace gas exchange measurements were made at each of the Ivotuk sites using the eddy covariance technique. The MAT site was operated continuously over the growing season whilst the remaining sites were characterized by a single tower that was moved from site to site. The MAT site is therefore used as a reference. This dataset is available in both ASCII and EXCEL formats - For data browsing, we suggest ordering the EXCEL version and using EXCEL to plot the data.

Backscatter data are provided as separate grids depending on mapping system or processing method. The raster data file is included in "BackscatterC_Swath_OffshoreFortRoss.zip", which is accessible from http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/781/OffshoreFortRoss/data_catalog_OffshoreFortRoss.html. The acoustic-backscatter map of the Offshore of Fort Ross map area, California, was generated from backscatter data collected by California State University, Monterey Bay (CSUMB) and by Fugro Pelagos. Mapping was completed between 2007 and 2010, using a combination of 200-kHz and 400-kHz Reson 7125, and 244-kHz Reson 8101 multibeam echosounders, as well as 468-kHz SEA SWATHPlus interferometric system. These mapping missions combined to collect backscatter data from about the 10-m isobath to beyond the 3-nautical-mile limit of California State Waters. Within the acoustic-backscatter imagery, brighter tones indicate higher backscatter intensity, and darker tones indicate lower backscatter intensity. The intensity represents a complex interaction between the acoustic pulse and the seafloor, as well as characteristics within the shallow subsurface, providing a general indication of seafloor texture and composition. Backscatter intensity depends on the acoustic source level; the frequency used to image the seafloor; the grazing angle; the composition and character of the seafloor, including grain size, water content, bulk density, and seafloor roughness; and some biological cover. Harder and rougher bottom types such as rocky outcrops or coarse sediment typically return stronger intensities (high backscatter, lighter tones), whereas softer bottom types such as fine sediment return weaker intensities (low backscatter, darker tones). These data are not intended for navigational purposes.This data set includes data collected in August 2000 and covers coastlines of the states of South Carolina and North Carolina. Laser beach mapping uses a pulsed laser ranging system mounted onboard an aircraft to measure ground elevation and coastal topography. The laser emits laser beams at high frequency and is directed downward at the earth's surface through a port opening in the bottom of the aircraft's fuselage. The laser system records the time difference between emission of the laser beam and the reception of the reflected laser signal in the aircraft. The aircraft travels over the beach at approximately 60 meters per second while surveying from the low water line to the landward base of the sand dunes.N/ATo expand data functionality and capabilities for users of The National Map of the U.S. Geological Survey, data sets for six watersheds and three urban areas were converted from the Best Practices vector data model formats to Semantic Web data formats.Tradeology, the ITA Blog Search Tradeology, the ITA Blog - Tradeology.

Therefore, as part of FEMA s Map Modernization Program, a Tsunami Pilot Study was carried out in the Seaside/Gearhart, Oregon, area to develop an improved Probabilistic Tsunami Hazard Assessment (PTHA) methodology and to provide recommendations for improved tsunami hazard assessment guidelines. The Seaside area was chosen because it is typical of many coastal communities in the section of the Pacific Coast from Cape Mendocino to the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and because State Agencies and local stakeholders expressed considerable interest in mapping the tsunami threat to this area. The study was an interagency effort by FEMA, U.S. Geological Survey and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, in collaboration with the University of Southern California, Middle East Technical University. Portland State University, Horning Geosciences, Northwest Hydraulics Consultants, and the Oregon Department of Geological and Mineral Industries.

The National Flood Hazard Layer is a computer database that contains FEMA's flood hazard map data. The data depict flood hazard information and supporting data used to develop the information. The primary hazard classifications are the 1 percent-annual-chance flood event, the 0.2 percent-annual-chance flood event, and areas of minimal flood hazard. Flood hazard and supporting data are developed using specifications for horizontal control consistent with 1:12,000-scale mapping. If you plan to display maps from the National Flood Hazard Layer with other map data for official purposes, ensure that the other information meets FEMA's standards for map accuracy. The NFHL data are from FEMA's Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM) databases. New data are added continually. The NFHL also contains changes to DFIRM data made by Letters of Map Revision (LOMRs). The service provides map images geo-referenced to the earth's surface using the North American Datum of 1983, Geodetic Reference System 80 coordinate system.The temperature, humidity, wind, and pressure systems (THWAPS) provide surface reference values of these measurements for balloon-borne sounding system (BBSS) launches.

The THWAPS system is a combination of calibration-quality instruments intended to provide accurate measurements of meteorological conditions near the surface. Although the primary use of the system is to prov ide accurate surface reference values of temperature, pressure, relative humidity (RH), and wind velocity for comparison with radiosonde readings, the system includes a data logger to record time series of the measured variables.We estimated mean volumes of 3.2 billion barrels of oil, 23.63 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, and 721 million barrels of natural gas liquids in this area using a geology-based assessment methodology.This project currently supports two main efforts: 1. A bi-weekly sampling regime of the hydrology and plankton along a transect over the Continental Shelf starting at Newport. This consistent survey has generated significant information on within-year variability in the California Current Marine Ecosystem, and has yielded valuable insights into the food web involving juvenile salmon. Parameters collected during this effort are used in forecasts involving species, assemblages, and ecosystems. 2. The SAIP work has supported studies of the prey field that juvenile salmon interact with. Some of this data is used to forecast juvenile salmon returns, and can also assist in preliminary evaluations of hatchery wild interactions and other density-dependent questions. We towed a Nordic trawl (30x18 m) at 30 m at all stationsDescriptions of amphibians and examples of the deleterious effects of nonindigenous species, with links to distribution maps, species lists and related information on amphibians.The survey consists of 120 random stratified stations in the Middle Atlantic Bight, Southern New England, Georges Bank and the Gulf of Maine. Depending on the duration of the cruise and weather, fewer stations might be samples. These will be sampled with an array of bongo nets: a 61 cm bongo frame equipped with two 333 micron mesh nets, and a smaller 20 cm bongo frame equipped with two nets of that same mesh A subset of 15 stations from the cruise will be sampled with a similar array except that the 20 cm bongo frames will be equipped with 165 micron mesh nets. There will be five fixed position stations in the Gulf of Maine that will be sampled for plankton using a bongo net, and for water using a Niskin bottle rosette equipped with 12 10-liter bottles provided by the Northeast Fisheries Science Center. There will also be an additional thirty fixed position stations that will be sampled using only the Niskin bottle rosette sampler. The rosette sampler will be equipped with a Laser In-Situ Scattering and Transmissometry (LISST) instrument mounted horizontally on the rosette frame below the Niskin bottles to provide particulate counts and measurements.

They serve as a source of information in the event of an oil spill incident. ESI maps contain three types of information: shoreline habitats (classified according to their sensitivity to oiling), sensitive biological resources, and human-use resources. Most often, this information is plotted on 7.5 minute USGS quadrangles, although in the Alaska ESI maps, USGS topographic maps at scales of 1:63,360 and 1:250,000 are used, and in other ESI maps, NOAA charts have been used as the base map. Collections of these maps, grouped by state or a logical geographic area, are published as ESI atlases. Digital data have been published for most of the U.S. shoreline, including Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.Pacific Science Center inspires a lifelong interest in science, math and technology by engaging diverse communities through interactive and innovative exhibits and programs.Aeromagnetic surveys of New England, merged to form seamless grids across the state. Gravity anomaly data are provided as well. Data provided in a variety of formats.The Global Telecommunications System (GTS) is a major component of transmitting global meteorological data, consisting of both in situ and satellite observations. This data is collected by a number of organizations, which archive and further process the data. The National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) collect this GTS data and formats it into BUFR (Binary Universal Form for the Representation of meteorological data) for their processing needs. After processing, the BUFR is transmitted to NCAR for archival and additional processing into the International Maritime Meteorological Archive (IMMA) format for the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS). NCAR also archives this IMMA-formatted data. NCDC will use these data as source input for the new ICOADS Near-Real-Time (NRT) product and will archive the two data streams from NCAR--the NCEP-BUFR data as well as IMMA (International Maritime Meteorological Archive) formatted data files (converted from the NCEP-BUFR file format) that are produced by NCAR. The IMMA format has been adopted by many organizations as the preferred format for marine observations. The data consists of basic observations taken from ships, buoys, C-MAN (Coastal Marine Automated Network), and tide-gauge stations. Observations may include: air and sea surface temperature, wind direction/speed, waves, sea level pressure, etc.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

Sonar data were collected November 6 to December 15, 2009, in the estuary north from Saugerties to Troy. Data Collection and Processing: The interferometric system used to measure acoustic reflectivity, provided a quantitative measure of reflectivity for every square meter of the survey area. Fugro's system measured and recorded acoustic reflectivity that has a high dynamic range such that the full range of reflectivity's encountered in the estuary environment can be recorded while maintaining a constant gain setting on the system receiver. Reflectivity data from the GeoSwath was used to produce a normalized as well as a classified image of the bottom. Additionally, Fugro provided slope, aspect and hillshade models as additional acoustic parameters. Backscatter data processing was completed with CARIS 7.0.

CORMP consists of four focus areas: Ocean Observations, Data Management, Ecosystem Research and Modeling, and Outreach and Education that operate synergistically to: 1) provide a regional hub (SE US) in a national observing system; 2) collect and disseminate physical and ecological data; and 3) engage regional partners, stakeholders and end-users in the development and implementation of a sustainable coastal-ocean observing program. CORMP capitalizes on a combination of instrumented moorings, remote sensing and ecosystem models, and traditional ship-based observations to establish baseline conditions, identify responses to stochastic events, predict and verify long-term trends and identify linkages among coastal ocean ecosystem components. The information collected by CORMP help researchers determine a mechanistic understanding of factors affecting productivity in the coastal ocean in the region and will provide information that can be and is directly used in local-to federal fisheries management. Further, information collected by CORMP will be used by partner organizations to provide a real-time forecasting. The operational area for the CORMP observing network extends from estuaries (including the Cape Fear River Estuary and it's plume) to the coast, across the continental margin to the Gulf Stream, and from the SC/NC border to north of Cape Lookout. <1> Mooring: Core variables collected at each mooring includes water temperature and salinity, water column currents, surface wave directional spectra data. On some selected mooring stations, CORMP also measure turbidity and fluorescence. <2> Cruise: We sample the cape fear river plume every month by collecting data with a YSI-6820 Water Quality Sonde. This instrument measures (Temperature, Salinity, pH, Conductivity, Dissolved Oxygen, and Turbidity.) We collect Total Nitrate, Total phosphate, Nitrate, Phosphate, Ammonium and Chlorophyll a. Zooplankton samples are also collected at four of the plume stations. Our Onslow Bay sampling cruises are conducted bi-monthly. We sample six stations, each approximately five nautical miles apart, beginning at the Masonboro Inlet sea buoy and extending out to approximately 27 miles offshore. Our most offshore sampling station (OB27) also serves as the location for a fixed underwater instrument mooring. Basic data including time (GMT), latitude, longitude, water depth, sea surface temperature, weather conditions, and sea state are noted upon arrival at every station. When on station, scientists take measurements of physical parameters (temperature, currents, salinity, etc.), light attenuation and collect water samples for analysis of nutrients, phytoplankton pigments, and CDOM using a Seabird SBE-25 CTD rosette.WMSUSGS real-time landslide monitoring provides prompt notification of landslide activity, advances our understanding of landslide behavior, and enables more effective engineering and planning efforts.Images from the Landsat 5 and Landsat 7 satellites chosen for their aesthetic appeal, with color manipulated to enhance color variation or details.Maps and diagrams showing how the mathematical model predicts the distribution of various pollutants within a large watershed.The European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) is a European Union agency charged with reducing the risk of maritime accidents, marine pollution from ships and the loss of human lives at sea by helping to enforce the pertinent EU legislation.

The project was coordinated by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources and several partners including the U.S. Geological Survey, the Minnesota Department of Transportation, and staff from the affected counties. The data was collected by AeroMetric, Inc. (now Quantum Spatial) in November 2008 and was delivered in tiles that covered an area 1/16th of a 1:24,000-scale USGS quadrangle (approximately 3.25 square miles). DNR conducted the QA/QC starting April 2009. As part of the processing, one- and three-meter county mosaic DEMs were created and used for visual quality assessment. Note: This metadata record was created at the Minnesota Geospatial Information Office by combining information supplied by AeroMetric and the DNR.MDNInternational Association of Geophysical ContractorsThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

They serve as a source of information in the event of an oil spill incident. ESI maps contain three types of information: shoreline habitats (classified according to their sensitivity to oiling), sensitive biological resources, and human-use resources. Most often, this information is plotted on 7.5 minute USGS quadrangles, although in the Alaska ESI maps, USGS topographic maps at scales of 1:63,360 and 1:250,000 are used, and in other ESI maps, NOAA charts have been used as the base map. Collections of these maps, grouped by state or a logical geographic area, are published as ESI atlases. Digital data have been published for most of the U.S. shoreline, including Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.This cruise used the remotely operated vehicle (ROV) Jason II to: explore 4-6 new sites for the occurrence of deep water coral reefs; made collections of Lophelia and other corals for genetic and physiological studies, made collections of communities associated with Lophelia and other corals for ecological studies; collected quantitative digital imagery for characterization of sites and coral communities; collect spatially explicit physical near bottom oceanographic data; deploy cameras and microbial arrays; reposition larval traps and current meters; collected push cores; and conducted a series of linked archeological/ biological investigations on deep water shipwrecks.Search the web through Lost Souls using Google.Gennems g Debians websted.Data | City of BostonThe National Ocean Service (NOS) maintains a long-term database containing a listing of active stations that are installed all over the United States and U.S. territories.

The map, produced using GIS, shows where current drought areas are expected to improve, be removed, or persist with intensity, as well as new areas where drought may develop, at the end of the forecast period. The current drought areas are obtained from the most recent weekly U.S. Drought Monitor where drought is considered D1 (moderate drought) or worse. There are two narratives: a brief, general summary and a detailed, regional technical discussion that describes the thought process, forecast tools used, and confidence for each region on the map. These outlook products apply to the following 3-month period from the date of issue. Originally produced once a month on the third Thursday of each month, the SDOs were changed to twice a month in June 2007 (initial SDO third Thursday of month, updated SDO first Thursday of next month). Since June 30, 2013, however, the SDO is now produced once a month on the third Thursday. The forecast applies to all 50 states of the United States plus Puerto Rico.Consistent, historic, and up-to-date water-quality data, such as temperature, specific conductance, pH, nutrients, pesticides, and volatile organic compounds downloadable from the USGS National Water Information System as graphs, tables, or files.The NAIP 2014 Imagery Feedback map allows users to make comments and observations about the quality of the 2014 National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) acquisition.

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. The primary legal divisions of most States are termed counties. In Louisiana, these divisions are known as parishes. In Alaska, which has no counties, the equivalent entities are the organized boroughs, city and boroughs, and municipalities, and for the unorganized area, census areas. The latter are delineated cooperatively for statistical purposes by the State of Alaska and the Census Bureau. In four States (Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, and Virginia), there are one or more incorporated places that are independent of any county organization and thus constitute primary divisions of their States. These incorporated places are known as independent cities and are treated as equivalent entities for purposes of data presentation. The District of Columbia and Guam have no primary divisions, and each area is considered an equivalent entity for purposes of data presentation. The Census Bureau treats the following entities as equivalents of counties for purposes of data presentation: Municipios in Puerto Rico, Districts and Islands in American Samoa, Municipalities in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Islands in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The entire area of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas is covered by counties or equivalent entities.

For purposes of this project, WLH is a term used to describe those habitats associated with Vermont roads where wildlife move, migrate, and access various other habitats and parts of their range (similar to, but broader than, wildlife corridors). This project relied on available GIS data including: (a) land use and land cover data; (b) development density data (E911 sites); and (c) contiguous or "core" habitat data from the University of Vermont. The GIS conserved lands data was also used for this project as a way of analyzing the feasibility for conserving or ranking potentially significant WLHs identified as a result of this project. These data were classified according to their relative significance with respect to wildlife movement and habitat areas. The resulting spatial layer is a statewide raster coverage describing the predicability of finding suitable habitat.IPR Holder: Mersey Docks and Harbour Company; Purpose: Safety of navigation; IHO Sea: Irish Sea and the St. Georges Channel - 19; Survey Start: 2011-07-25; Survey End: 2011-07-25; Primary Instrument Type: Echosounder - multibeam; Primary Navigation Type: ;Characteristics of recent tsunami deposits, with the knowledge we have about the events that caused them, give us ways to recognize ancient deposits of this type and infer characteristics of those ancient tsunamis as well.Brief descriptions of research programs in water resources in Kentucky with a few links to program websites.

For more information contact John Lindgren at 208 327-7900. The existing Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer (ESPA) model is increasingly being used for water management decisions, and the Idaho Department of Water Resources (IDWR) intends to further use the model for conjunctive administration of surface and ground water. The present calibration of the ESPA model is based on hydrologic conditions representative of a single year (1980). This results in some uncertainty when the model is used to represent hydrologic conditions that are different from the conditions under which it was calibrated. Calibration using multi-year data sets will include a wider range of Snake Plain hydrologic conditions and will improve the confidence in the ESPA model. The purpose of the work described by the workplan herein is to improve the ESPA model and estimate confidence limits on parameters used in the model. Specific objectives include the following: Establish a coordinated approach to improve the ground water modeling of the ESPA to address the demands of current and emerging water resource issues within a reasonable cost and timeframe; Collect and analyze data that will enable more reliable simulations of ground-water flow in the Eastern Snake Plain to improve quantification of ground- and surface water interaction; Enhance, refine, re-calibrate, and document the existing model based on new data and improved calibration techniques; and Refine simulations of response to ground-water stresses on the basis of the recalibrated ESPA model. This workplan describes a multi-year effort that will be accomplished through collaborative partnerships, with technical advice provided by the Eastern Snake Hydrologic Modeling Committee. The committee is composed of experts and technical representatives from participating organizations and interested stakeholders. The ESPA model enhancement will be accomplished through collaborative partnerships between IDWR, Idaho Power Company (IPCo), the University of Idaho (UI), the Idaho Water Resources Research Institute (IWRRI), the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (USBR), and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).LEOs Portugiesisch-Deutsch Online W rterbuch Verwenden Sie LEOs Portugiesisch-Deutsch Online W rterbuch um einzelne W rter oder Phrasen vom Portugiesischen ins Deutsche (oder umgekehrt) zu bersetzen.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

Saline marshes generally have more oil-sensitive vegetation than freshwater marshes and oil impact on vegetation is most significant in highly organic soils of salt marshes. Cleaning activities such as skimming, oil collection, burning, flushing, use of dispersants and plant cutting can also greatly damage marshes. In addition, the effects of oil spill show seasonal and species specific variations (eg. Spartina alterniflora is more sensitive to oil contamination than Juncus roemerianus). Plants are more sensitive to oiling during the growing season than during the pre-dormancy or dormant season. Since the BP oil spill and cleaning up efforts occurring in summer, the growing season for Spartina spp., we hypothesize that short-term impacts of the spill on salt marshes will be detected. Most post-spill assessments of coastal salt marsh status will be limited to habitat delineation and documentation of change in area. However, assessment of marsh health is essential to the evaluation of the short-term impact of the spill and for the prioritization of future restoration actions. This study will allow the identification of hotspots of early stages of marsh degradation because of the oil spill which can only be delineated by evaluating marsh biophysical characteristics including distribution of chlorophyll content (Chl), green leaf area index (GLAI) (a ratio of green foliage area vs. ground area), and green vegetation fraction (VF) (percentage of green canopy cover). These biophysical characteristics are primary indicators of photosynthetic capacity, nitrogen content and physiological status of vegetation. Monitoring these characteristics through remotely sensed data can help us infer the overall health and productivity of these valuable natural resources on a larger scale so that effective management strategies can be implemented in high priority areas. In order to quantify the short-term impact of the oil spill on the photosynthetic activity and physiological status of the coastal salt marshes, we initiated field surveys in Mississippi and Louisiana salt marshes. We will combine field data with the LANDSAT 30m datasets to retrieve the described biophysical characteristics in Louisiana and Mississippi salt marshes before and after the spill. By examining the biophysical parameters using remotely sensed data, we can infer the overall health and productivity of coastal marshland. The question to be answered through study is: What is the impact of the oil and oil/dispersant on health and productivity of wetlands? The proposed research develops scientific products that can be used to assess marsh physiological characteristics at large spatial scales, which will directly inform restoration and conservation decision-making.With the addition of elevation and land use and land cover data, we can show population density on a map much more effectively than if we simply color census areas. The resulting maps should allow better planning, especially in highly developed areas.The Map of the Elevation of the Bedrock Surface in Iowa was compiled using all available data, principally information from GEOSAM, supplemented with well and boring information from the Iowa DOT, exposure reports from Iowa Geological & Water Survey reports and files, and the Department of Soil Conservation county soils maps for Iowa. The soils maps were especially valuable, since they identified soils that encountered bedrock within the soil horizon, and less dependably also spot-located rock exposures. A 50 foot contour interval was chosen for the map because it was considered to best represent the accuracy of the well data, allowed for fairly good representation of the bedrock surface in areas with limited well control, and was mappable in high relief areas (the contours packed so close together that it precluded mapping or forced the software to snap-join contours). The 50 foot contour interval also allowed areas where bedrock was present within the soil horizon (2-3 feet) to be treated as areas of exposures. In these areas the bedrock elevation was mapped as only slightly below the surface elevation, so contours on the 7 ' topographic maps were closely followed in mapping the bedrock elevation. Consequently, on the completed map of bedrock elevation, these areas display much more contorted and crenulated contour lines than the areas where only drill control was utilized. This allows the user a general feeling for the accuracy of the map; the more crenulated the contours, the more control was available for the mapping, and the more accurate is the mapping.powered by the HUBzero(R) Platform for Scientific CollaborationConsistent, historic, and up-to-date surface-water data, such as gage height (stage) and streamflow (discharge), collected at major rivers, lakes, and reservoirs, downloadable from the USGS National Water Information System as graphs, tables, or files.CEH Information Gateway The catalogue of the CEH Information Gateway describes data holdings and services managed by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH).

The information encoded about these features includes classification and other characteristics, delineation, geographic name, position and related measures, a "reach code" through which other information can be related to the NHD, and the direction of water flow. The network of reach codes delineating water and transported material flow allows users to trace movement in upstream and downstream directions. In addition to this geographic information, the dataset contains metadata that supports the exchange of future updates and improvements to the data. The NHD is available nationwide in two seamless datasets, one based on 1:24,000-scale maps and referred to as high resolution NHD, and the other based on 1:100,000-scale maps and referred to as medium resolution NHD. Additional selected areas in the United States are available based on larger scales, such as 1:5,000-scale or greater, and referred to as local resolution NHD. The NHD from The National Map supports many applications, such as making maps, geocoding observations, flow modeling, data maintenance, and stewardship. For additional information on the NHD, go to http://nhd.usgs.gov/index.html. The Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) is a companion dataset to the NHD. It defines the perimeter of drainage areas formed by the terrain and other landscape characteristics. The drainage areas are nested within each other so that a large drainage area, such as the Upper Mississippi River, will be composed of multiple smaller drainage areas, such as the Wisconsin River. Each of these smaller areas can further be subdivided into smaller and smaller drainage areas. The WBD uses six different levels in this hierarchy, with the smallest averaging about 30,000 acres. The WBD is made up of polygons nested into six levels of data respectively defined by Regions, Subregions, Basins, Subbasins, Watersheds, and Subwatersheds. For additional information on the WBD, go to http://nhd.usgs.gov/wbd.html. The National Map hydrography data is commonly combined with other data themes, such as boundaries, elevation, structures, and transportation, to produce general reference base maps. The National Map viewer allows free downloads of public domain NHD and WBD data in either Esri File or Personal Geodatabase, or Shapefile formats.These events range from minor operational problems to permanent spacecraft failures. Australia, Canada, Germany, India, Japan, United Kingdom, and the United States have contributed data. This data base of known satellite anomalies is used to study and identify trends in the anomalous behavior of different families of satellites. The trends include seasonal groupings, diurnal groupings, and anomaly types indicative of certain satellite types and manufacturers. Corrections are done with several Solar-terrestrial data sets. Specifically, geomagnetic activity has been found to have significant effects on satellite behavior. Solar activity and cosmic rays have also proven to be important in the anomalous behavior of satellites. Information provided by this program can be used in the design phase of spacecraft to prevent the propagation of problems from one spacecraft to the next. This information can also be used by operations personnel to anticipate periods of anomalous behavior based on the proven response of an existing craft to environmental conditions.A regional Level 2P Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) dataset for the Atlantic Ocean and nearby regions based on multi-channel sea surface temperature (SST) retrievals from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) on the NOAA-16 platform (launched on 21 Sep 2000). The AVHRR is a space-borne scanning sensor on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) family of Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites (POES) having a operational legacy that traces back to the Television Infrared Observation Satellite-N (TIROS-N) launched in 1978. AVHRR instruments measure the radiance of the Earth in 5 (or 6) relatively wide spectral bands. The first two are centered around the red (0.6 micrometer) and near-infrared (0.9 micrometer) regions, the third one is located around 3.5 micrometer, and the last two sample the emitted thermal radiation, around 11 and 12 micrometers, respectively. The legacy 5 band instrument is known as AVHRR/2 while the more recent version, the AVHRR/3 (first carried on the NOAA-15 platform), acquires data in a 6th channel located at 1.6 micrometer. Typically the 11 and 12 micron channels are used to derive sea surface temperature (SST) sometimes in combination with the 3.5 micron channel. The highest ground resolution that can be obtained from the current AVHRR instruments is 1.1 km at nadir. The NOAA platforms are sun synchronous generally viewing the same earth location twice a day (latitude dependent) due to the relatively large AVHRR swath of approximately 2400 km. This particular dataset is derived from Local Area Coverage (LAC) binary AVHRR SST binary data originally produced by the US Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVO) and downloaded from the NASA Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center (PO.DAAC). LAC are full resolution AVHRR data whose acquisition is prescheduled and recorded with an on-board tape recorder for subsequent transmission during a station overpass. Finally, L2P data products are derived following the GHRSST-PP Data Processing Specification (GDS) version 1.5 including Single Sensor Error Statistics (SSES).EX1205 Leg 2 is the final cruise of the 2012 season for Okeanos Explorer (EX).

The ISH dataset includes global data obtained from the USAF Climatology Center, located in the Federal Climate Complex with NCDC. The latest daily summary data are normally available 1-2 days after the date-time of the observations used in the daily summaries. The online data files begin with 1929 and are at the time of this writing at the Version 8 software level. Over 9000 stations' data are typically available. The daily elements included in the dataset (as available from each station) are: Mean temperature (.1 Fahrenheit) Mean dew point (.1 Fahrenheit) Mean sea level pressure (.1 mb) Mean station pressure (.1 mb) Mean visibility (.1 miles) Mean wind speed (.1 knots) Maximum sustained wind speed (.1 knots) Maximum wind gust (.1 knots) Maximum temperature (.1 Fahrenheit) Minimum temperature (.1 Fahrenheit) Precipitation amount (.01 inches) Snow depth (.1 inches) Indicator for occurrence of: Fog, Rain or Drizzle, Snow or Ice Pellets, Hail, Thunder, Tornado/Funnel Cloud Global summary of day data for 18 surface meteorological elements are derived from the synoptic/hourly observations contained in USAF DATSAV3 Surface data and Federal Climate Complex Integrated Surface Hourly (ISH). Historical data are generally available for 1929 to the present, with data from 1973 to the present being the most complete. For some periods, one or more countries' data may not be available due to data restrictions or communications problems. In deriving the summary of day data, a minimum of 4 observations for the day must be present (allows for stations which report 4 synoptic observations/day). Since the data are converted to constant units (e.g, knots), slight rounding error from the originally reported values may occur (e.g, 9.9 instead of 10.0). The mean daily values described below are based on the hours of operation for the station. For some stations/countries, the visibility will sometimes 'cluster' around a value (such as 10 miles) due to the practice of not reporting visibilities greater than certain distances. The daily extremes and totals--maximum wind gust, precipitation amount, and snow depth--will only appear if the station reports the data sufficiently to provide a valid value. Therefore, these three elements will appear less frequently than other values. Also, these elements are derived from the stations' reports during the day, and may comprise a 24-hour period which includes a portion of the previous day. The data are reported and summarized based on Greenwich Mean Time (GMT, 0000Z - 2359Z) since the original synoptic/hourly data are reported and based on GMT.The International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS) Near-Real-Time (NRT) product is an extension of the official ICOADS dataset with preliminary Global Telecommunication System (GTS) data. The data is only considered 'preliminary' until fully incorporated into a full update of the ICOADS dataset. This data set is a merged product from various marine GTS data containing surface marine observations from many different observing systems, creating a complete and heterogeneous collection of surface marine data. Observations are taken primarily from ships (merchant, ocean research, fishing, navy, etc.) and moored and drifting buoys. Each report contains individual observations of meteorological and oceanographic variables, such as sea surface and air temperatures, winds, pressure, humidity, wet bulb, dew point, ocean waves and cloudiness. The data are marine GTS data in IMMA format that are quality controlled and blended together, first with duplicates (Intermediate product), then quality controlled for final product with a final output summary. The intermediate output is used to conduct studies on the GTS transmissions, duplicates, ship tracking, etc. Then the data is blended through a duplicate elimination routine (dupelim) for a single monthly product. The Output Summary product is a statistical summary of the dataset along with justifications for duplicate deletions that occurred during the blending process. User groups include sea surface temperature analysis, global surface temperature analysis, model/reanalysis input, and general ocean research. The dataset will be produced and archived monthly. Spatial coverage is global and the current period of record for these files will begin in January 2008 to the most current month. Any updates will not be incorporated in this dataset, but will be added to the new releases of the official ICOADS dataset in delayed mode. The data will be formated to the most current IMMA standard in ASCII file format.The Public Land spatial data sets (shapefile) contains Public Land Survey section polygons that had mining claims recorded in the U.S. Bureau of Land Management's LR2000 database as of December 31, 2010 (from a March 1, 2011 data extraction) for the period from 1976 to 2010 in Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, Nevada, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming.

This data set is meteorological data gathered by Lockheed WP-3D Orion aircraft, operated by the NOAA Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) at MacDill AFB, Florida. Data is provided by the Science and Engineering Division of AOC to the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC). The WP-3D aircraft perform many projects throughout the year. Examples of these projects would be hurricane research, atmospheric chemistry, thunderstorm investigations, and winter weather missions. Each of these projects consists of a series of individual flights. For instance, during hurricane projects, the P-3 may fly numerous flights through different tropical cyclones. For each archived project, there are multiple directories consisting of individual flights. The data in these flight directories contain the actual raw meteorological parameters obtained from sensors located in different positions on the aircraft. The data is initially written to a digital data tape on the aircraft and then later converted to a file for faster processing and archiving. Each flight folder also contains a scanned image of the actual flight manifest, the navigation log, and the mission observation logs. The flight-level data file contains measurements acquired in one second intervals. The following is a generalized list of these measured parameters: Time, GPS position data, inertial data, radar altimeter measurements, liquid water, total temperature, dewpoint temperature, attack pressure, slip pressure, differential attack and slip pressures, and static and dynamic pressure. Depending on the needs of each individual project, other sources of data will be added or subtracted from this list. As of publication this record consists of 5 projects: 1) NOAA-42 Aircraft-N42RF during the 2003 Hurricane season, the Tamdar project, and a wind calibration flight. 2) NOAA-43 Aircraft-N43RF-2003 Sar Pod, Hurricane, and Extratropical Season as well as the SFMR test flight missions. 3) NOAA-49 Aircraft-N49RF 2004 Winter Storms Experiment. 4) NOAA-43 Name Experiment 2004. 5) NOAA-49 Aircraft N49RF Hurricane Season 2004.Everyone in your family, children and adults, can learn how to prepare for an earthquake.

Towboard surveys) are conducted by the Coral Reef Ecosystem Division (CRED) of the NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC) as part of biennial Pacific Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program (RAMP) Cruises. These cruises support NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program (CRCP) long-term goals for sustainable management and conservation of coral reef ecosystems. 6 towboard surveys (13.918 km in length), were conducted at Laysan Island in the NW Hawaiian Islands from 08 September - 06 October 2000 as part of RAMP Cruise TC0011. Towboard surveys are a good method for obtaining a general description of large reef areas, assessing the status of low-density populations of large-bodied reef fish, large-scale disturbances (e.g., bleaching), general distribution and abundance patterns of macro-invertebrates (e.g., COT, giant clams), and for assessing trends in these populations and metrics. A pair of scuba divers (1 fish and 1 benthic diver) are towed 60 m behind a small survey launch at a speed of 1-2 knots and a depth of approximately 15m. Each survey is 50 min long, covers about 2 km of habitat, and is divided into ten 5-minute survey segments. The fish diver records, to the lowest possible taxon, all large-bodied reef fishes (>50cmTL) seen within 5m either side and 10m in front of the towboard. Length of each individual is estimated to the nearest cm. The fish towboard is also outfitted with a forward-facing digital video camera to record the survey swath. The benthic diver records percent cover of coral and macroalgae, estimates benthic habitat type and complexity, and censuses a suite of benthic macroinvertebrates including Crown of Thorns sea stars and sea urchins. The benthic towboard is equipped with a downward-facing digital still camera which images the benthos at 15 second intervals. These images are analyzed for percent cover of coral, algae, and other benthic components. Both towboards are equipped with SEABIRD SBE-39 temperature/depth sensors set to record at 5 second intervals. Latitude and longitude of each survey track is recorded at 15 second intervals using a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver onboard the tow boat. A layback algorithm is applied to more accurately map the position of the divers with respect to the reef environment. This algorithm calculates the position of the divers based on the position of the tow boat taking into account the length of the tow rope, the depth of the divers, and the curvature of the survey track. This metadata applies to the fish biomass observations.Modified version of paper by F.T. Manheim and A.G. McIntire, Civil Engineering Practice, Vol. 13, No. 1, pp. 35-48 (1998).

Dozens of weather parameters are available from the NAM grids, from temperature and precipitation to lightning and turbulent kinetic energy. The NAM generates multiple grids (or domains) of weather forecasts over the North American continent at various horizontal resolutions. High-resolution forecasts are generated within the NAM using additional numerical weather models. These high-resolution forecast windows are generated over fixed regions and are occasionally run to follow significant weather events, like hurricanes. This dataset contains a 12 km horizontal resolution Lambert Conformal grid covering the Continental United States (CONUS) domain. It is run four times daily at 00z, 06z, 12z and 18z out to 84 hours with a 1 hour temporal resolution.This project is a cooperative effort among the National Ocean Service, National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science, Center for Coastal Monitoring and Assessment; the University of Hawaii; and Analytical Laboratories of Hawaii, LLC. IKONOS imagery was purchased to support the Pacific Islands Geographic Information System (GIS) project and the National Ocean Service's (NOS) coral mapping activities. One-meter panchromatic and four-meter multi-spectral data were purchased for each study area. The enhanced spectral resolution of multispectral imagery and control of bandwidths of multispectral data yield an advantage over color aerial photography particularly when coral health and time series analysis of coral reef community structure are of interest. The IKONOS imagery was processed to minimize atmospheric and water column effects. Photointerpreters can accurately and reliably delineate boundaries of features in the imagery as they appear on the computer monitor using a software interface such as the Habitat Digitizer.Study of the effects on the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary resulting from the disposal of San Francisco dredged material and barrels of low-level radioactive waste with links to publications and atlas with digital images.Gridded bathymetry and IKONOS estimated depths of the shelf and slope environments of Midway Atoll, Hawaii, USA.

Version 3 was released in September 2012 with the addition of data from two additional station networks. Changes to the processing system associated with the version 3 release also allowed for updates to occur 7 days a week rather than only on most weekdays. Version 3 contains station-based measurements from well over 90,000 land-based stations worldwide, about two thirds of which are for precipitation measurement only. Other meteorological elements include, but are not limited to, daily maximum and minimum temperature, temperature at the time of observation, snowfall and snow depth. Over 25,000 stations are regularly updated with observations from within roughly the last month. The dataset is also routinely reconstructed (usually every week) from its roughly 30 data sources to ensure that GHCN-Daily is generally in sync with its growing list of constituent sources. During this process, quality assurance checks are applied to the full dataset. Where possible, GHCN-Daily station data are also updated daily from a variety of data streams. Station values for each daily update also undergo a suite of quality checks.Joomla! - the dynamic portal engine and content management systemThis project is a cooperative effort among the National Ocean Service, National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science, Center for Coastal Monitoring and Assessment; the University of Hawaii; BAE Systems Spectral Solutions; and Analytical Laboratories of Hawaii, LLC.

Aerial photographs are valuable tools for natural resource managers and researchers since they provide an excellent record of the location and extent of habitats. However,spatial distortions in aerial photographs due to such factors as camera angle, lens characteristics, and relief displacement must be accounted for during analysis to prevent incorrect measurements of area, distance, and other spatial parameters. These distortions of scale within an image can be removed through orthorectification. During orthorectification, digital scans of aerial photos are subjected to algorithms that eliminate each source of spatial distortion. The result is a georeferenced digital mosaic of several photographs with uniform scale throughout the mosaic. Features near land are generally georeferenced with greater accuracy while the accuracy of features away from land is generally not as good. Where no land is in the original photographic frame only kinematic GPS locations and image tie points were used to georeference the images. After the orthorectified mosaics were created, photointerpreters were able to accurately and reliably delineate boundaries of features in the imagery as they appear on the computer monitor.This digitally compiled map includes geology, oil and gas fields, and geologic provinces of Europe.

Measurements were taken from 42,000 grid points out to a distance of 50 nautical miles from shore. Values represent the average instantaneous power generated by a meter length of wave crest per grid point. In accordance with accepted global practice, wave power density is measured in kilowatts per meter of wave crest aggregated across a unit diameter circle. Data were classified using quantiles. Bathymetric effects are known to have a large effect on wave characteristics at depths shallower than ~20m on the east coast and ~50m on the west coast. Reliable site-specific information in shallow waters can only be produced using results from models with higher spatial resolution that include shallow-water physics. Results may not be accurate in the shallower waters of the inner continental shelf. These areas are indicated by dark gray regions.

Some studies occurred in areas without post-fire management, and others in moderately or intensively managed areas. Some of the research also occurred immediately after a wildfire, and other work occurThe International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS) dataset was developed by the NOAA National Climatic Data Center, which took the initial step of synthesizing and merging best track data from all official Tropical Cyclone Warning Centers (TCWCs) and the WMO Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers (RSMCs) who are responsible for developing and archiving best track data worldwide. In recognizing the deficiency in global tropical cyclone data, and the lack of a publically available dataset, the IBTrACS dataset was produced, which, for the first time, combines existing best track data from over 10 international forecast centers. The dataset contains the position, maximum sustained winds, minimum central pressure, and storm nature for every tropical cyclone globally at 6-hr intervals in UTC. Statistics from the merge are also provided (such as number of centers tracking the storm, range in pressure, median wind speed, etc.). The dataset period is from 1848 to the present with dataset updates performed annually in August. The dataset is archived as netCDF files but can be accessed via a variety of user-friendly formats to facilitate data analysis, including netCDF, Shapefile, and CSV formatted files.

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. The Address Ranges Relationship File (ADDR.dbf) contains the attributes of each address range. Each address range applies to a single edge and has a unique address range identifier (ARID) value. The edge to which an address range applies can be determined by linking the address range to the All Lines Shapefile (EDGES.shp) using the permanent topological edge identifier (TLID) attribute. Multiple address ranges can apply to the same edge since an edge can have multiple address ranges. Note that the most inclusive address range associated with each side of a street edge already appears in the All Lines Shapefile (EDGES.shp). The TIGER/Line Shapefiles contain potential address ranges, not individual addresses. The term "address range" refers to the collection of all possible structure numbers from the first structure number to the last structure number and all numbers of a specified parity in between along an edge side relative to the direction in which the edge is coded. The address ranges in the TIGER/Line Shapefiles are potential ranges that include the full range of possible structure numbers even though the actual structures may not exist.Homepage for the USGS library system with links to the four libraries of the system, online catalog, forms to request information, photo archive, new acquisitions lists, and links to other useful sources of information.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

The weather slowed our transit time to Bering Site 2 from approximately 19 hrs to more than 29 hours. Bering Sea Site 2 - When we arrived at site 2, we began CTD/chlorophyll/nutrient/oxygen and bongo ops at the southernmost box station. The station was successfully completed and we slowly b?? due to weather b?? made our way to the westernmost box station b?? averaging between 5 and 6 knots. This station was also successfully completed, but shipb??s personnel concluded that due to a combination of the weather and personnel inexperience in the challenging sea conditions, operations would be suspended. After a safety meeting among shipb??s personnel, it was decided that the survey person, would monitor the operations area for safety considerations. Deployment and recovery of gear that was normally performed by a survey tech and deck hand would now be done by a scientist and a deck hand. Operations resumed at mid-morning - CTD/chlorophyll/nutrient/oxygen and bongo ops at the remaining box stations were completed. The center station was completed with 2 CTD/chlorophyll/nutrient/oxygen/DIC casts, a bongo and triplicate CalVET tows. We waited overnight hoping for improving weather conditions, but in the morning concluded that we should head north to Bering Sea site 5. Bering Sea Site 5 b?? We deployed 2 subsurface moorings (mooring recoveries at this site had been conducted previously on a contract vessel). A CTD/chlorophyll/nutrient/oxygen/DIC casts, a bongo and triplicate CalVET tows were completed after mooring operations. We then completed the box of stations surrounding site 5 b?? with a CTD/chlorophyll/nutrient/oxygen and bongo at each station. Bering Sea Site 4 b?? We deployed 2 subsurface moorings (there were no moorings to be recovered at this site). Two CTD/chlorophyll/nutrient/oxygen/DIC casts, a bongo and triplicate CalVET tows were completed after mooring operations. We then completed the box of stations surrounding site 4 b?? with a CTD/chlorophyll/nutrient/oxygen and bongo at each station. Bering Sea Site 2 b?? A small boat was launched to recover the fragile instruments on the surface buoy tower. A surface mooring and two subsurface moorings were successfully recovered. Two subsurface moorings were successfully deployed. Three CTD/chlorophyll/nutrient/oxygen/DIC casts were completed. CTD and bongo line b?? A line of eight CTD/chlorophyll/nutrient/oxygen and bongo tows - starting at site 2 and working towards site 4 - were completed. The last seven casts included DIC samples.This project is a cooperative effort between the National Ocean Service, National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science, Center for Coastal Monitoring and Assessment, the University of Hawaii, and Analytical Laboratories of Hawaii, LLC. The goal of the work was to develop coral reef mapping methods and compare benthic habitat maps generated by photointerpreting georeferenced color aerial photography, hyperspectral and IKONOS satellite imagery. The enhanced spectral resolution of hyperspectral and control of bandwidths of multispectral data yield an advantage over color aerial photography particularly when coral health and time series analysis of coral reef community structure are of interest. Depending on the type of instrument, a spectral imaging system can be utilized to see multiple colors from ultraviolet through the far infrared range. The AURORA hyperspectral imaging system collected 72 ten nm bands in the visible and near infrared spectral range with a 3 meter pixel resolution. The data was processed to select band widths, which optimized feature detection in shallow and deep water. Photointerpreters can accurately and reliably delineate boundaries of features in the imagery as they appear on the computer monitor using a software interface such as the Habitat Digitizer.This CD-ROM contains digital high resolution seismic reflection data collected during the USGS Diane G 97032 cruise. The coverage is the nearshore of Long Island, NY in the vicinity of Fire Island.

Tidal currents are almost always the strongest current experienced by vessels operating offshore and for considerable distances inside bays and river estuaries. Standardized procedures exist for analyzing tidal current data to separate the tidal and nontidal parameters. The tidal parameters are used to produce the National Ocean Service Tidal Current Tables. There are currently 41 tidal current reference stations where daily predictions are made based on information obtained in short-term current studies. Additional predictions are made for 2200 locations referenced to these tidal current reference stations. Predictions have varying degrees of accuracy dependant on the age of the data, the length of the measurements and the degree of non tidal influence a given location experiences. A clear understanding of current patterns in ports and estuaries which have economical and commercial importance is vital to ensure safe navigation and help in preventing accidents. In ports where currents are dominated by non-tidal factors, real-time current measurements are preferred.Open Data | SocrataThis part of DS 781 presents data for the acoustic-backscatter map of the Offshore of Bolinas map area, California. Backscatter data are provided as separate grids depending on mapping system or processing method. The raster data files is included in "BackscatterC_7125_OffshoreBolinas.zip", which are accessible from http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/781/OffshoreBolinas/data_catalog_OffshoreBolinas.html. The acoustic-backscatter map of the Offshore of Bolinas map area, California, was generated from backscatter collected by California State University, Monterey Bay (CSUMB), by Fugro Pelagos, and by Moss Landing Marine Laboratory (MLML). Mapping was completed between 2004 and 2010, using a combination of 200-kHz and 400-kHz Reson 7125, and 244-kHz Reson 8101 multibeam echosounders, as well as 468-kHz SEA SWATHPlus and 250-kHz GeoSwath interferometric systems. Moss Landing Marine Laboratory mapped the nearshore region north of Bolinas in 2004 prior to the California Seafloor Mapping Program (CSMP). The nearshore region from south of Bolinas Lagoon to Stinson Beach was mapped by Fugro Pelagos in 2009 for a project outside of the CSMP and only bathymetry data were collected. Therefore, note that the shaded relief map coverage (see Bathymetry Hillshade--Offshore of Bolinas, California, DS 781) does not match the acoustic-backscatter map coverage (see Backscatter A-E--Offshore of Bolinas, California, DS 781). Within the acoustic-backscatter imagery, brighter tones indicate higher backscatter intensity, and darker tones indicate lower backscatter intensity. The intensity represents a complex interaction between the acoustic pulse and the seafloor, as well as characteristics within the shallow subsurface, providing a general indication of seafloor texture and sediment type. Backscatter intensity depends on the acoustic source level; the frequency used to image the seafloor; the grazing angle; the composition and character of the seafloor, including grain size, water content, bulk density, and seafloor roughness; and some biological cover. Harder and rougher bottom types such as rocky outcrops or coarse sediment typically return stronger intensities (high backscatter, lighter tones), whereas softer bottom types such as fine sediment return weaker intensities (low backscatter, darker tones). These data are not intended for navigational purposes.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

Ozone also results indirectly from traffic, as nitrogen oxides combine with volatile organic compounds in the presence of sunlight. Traffic exhaust pollutants are a major source of air pollution in California, especially in urban areas, and are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions. Vehicles run on conventional or diesel engines. Although diesel engines are more efficient, they emit more fine particles than convential engines, and according to the California Air Resources Board, diesel exhaust is responsible for 70 percent of the cancer risk that the average Californian faces from breathing toxic air pollutants (see http://www.oehha.ca.gov/public_info/facts/dieselfacts.html). Potential health effects from being exposed to traffic-exhaust pollutants include repiratory illnesses (including asthma), cardiovascular disease, adverse reproductive outcomes, cancer, and shortening of the life span.These data are part of the Brine Disposal Program funded by NOAA in the US Gulf of Mexico, conducted by R.

The NOAA ENCs are in S-57, a data standard developed by the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) to be used for the exchange of digital hydrographic data. NOAA ENCs can be used in Geographic Information Systems, (GIS) allowing for broader public access. Many GIS's, however cannot read an ENC's native S-57 format to address this problem. NOAA's ENC Direct to GIS web portal provides comprehensive access to display, query, and download all available large scale NOAA ENC data in a variety of GIS/CAD formats for non-navigational purposes using Internet mapping service technology. Nautical chart features contained within an NOAA ENC provide a detailed representation of the U.S. coastal and marine environment. This data includes coastal topography, bathymetry, landmarks, geographic place names and marine boundaries. Features in an NOAA ENC are limited in that they only represent the geographic region that is depicted in that particular NOAA ENC. By aggregating nautical features from all NOAA ENCs in the creation of GIS data, a contiguous depiction of the U.S coastal and marine environment is achieved.powered by the HUBzero(R) Platform for Scientific CollaborationLibrary Catalog may include: Data Management Plans, Cruise Plans, Cruise Summary Reports, Scientific "Quick Look Reports", Video Annotation Logs, Image Collections, Highlight Images, Video Collections, Highlight Video Clips, Dive Plans, Dive Summary Reports, Maps, Essays, News Articles, Presentations, Education Lesson Plans, Biographies, Web Logs/Summaries.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

This count of every resident in the United States was mandated by Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution and all households in the U.S. and individuals living in group quarters were required by law to respond to the 2010 Census questionnaire. The data collected by the decennial census determine the number of seats each state has in the U.S. House of Representatives and is also used to distribute billions in federal funds to local communities. The questionnaire consisted of a limited number of questions but allowed for the collection of information on the number of people in the household and their relationship to the householder, an individual's age, sex, race and Hispanic ethnicity, the number of housing units and whether those units are owner- or renter-occupied, or vacant. The first wave of results for sub-state geographic areas in New Mexico was released on March 15, 2011, through the Redistricting Data (PL94-171) Summary File. This batch of data covers the state, counties, places (both incorporated and unincorporated communities), tribal lands, school districts, neighborhoods (census tracts and block groups), individual census blocks, and other areas. The Redistricting products provide counts by race and Hispanic ethnicity for the total population and the population 18 years and over, and housing unit counts by occupancy status. The 2010 Census Redistricting Data Summary File can be used to redraw federal, state and local legislative districts under Public Law 94-171. This is an important purpose of the file and, indeed, state officials use the Redistricting Data to realign congressional and state legislative districts in their states, taking into account population shifts since the 2000 Census. More detailed population and housing characteristics will be released in the summer of 2011. The data in these particular RGIS Clearinghouse tables are for all Block Groups in Hidalgo County. There are two data tables. One provides total counts by major race groups and by Hispanic ethnicity, while the other provides proportions of the total population for these same groups. These files, along with file-specific descriptions (in Word and text formats) are available in a single zip file.Search Faculty of Business Induction on Brookes WikiWMSThe Global Hourly Summaries are simple indicators of observational normals which include climatic data summarizations and frequency distributions. These typically are statistical analyses of station data over 5-, 10-, 20-, 30-year or longer time periods. In a GIS map service, the results of these calculations are represented by a given symbology set for different statistical criteria and observation type. Having the ability to modify the symbology "on-the-fly" is a useful tool in the analysis of station trends, accuracy, and regional or localized variances. The summaries are computed from the global surface hourly dataset. This dataset totaling over 350 gigabytes is comprised of 40 different types of weather observations with 20,000 stations worldwide. NCDC and the U.S. Navy have developed these value added products in the form of hourly summaries from many of these observations.

The MTDB provides seamless national coverage with no overlaps or gaps between parts. Each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or it can be combined with shapefiles for other counties to cover a region or the entire nation. The Address Ranges Feature Shapefile (ADDRFEAT.dbf) contains the geospatial edge geometry and attributes of all unsuppressed address ranges for a county or county equivalent area. The term "address range" refers to the collection of all possible structure numbers from the first structure number to the last structure number and all numbers of a specified parity in between along an edge side relative to the direction in which the edge is coded. Single-address address ranges have been suppressed to maintain the confidentiality of the addresses they describe. Multiple coincident address range feature edge records are represented in the shapefile if more than one left or right address ranges are associated to the edge. The ADDRFEAT shapefile contains a record for each address range to street name combination. Address range associated to more than one street name are also represented by multiple coincident address range feature edge records. Note that the ADDRFEAT shapefile includes all unsuppressed address ranges compared to the All Lines Shapefile (EDGES.shp) which only includes the most inclusive address range associated with each side of a street edge. The TIGER/Line Shapefiles contain potential address ranges, not individual addresses. The address ranges in the TIGER/Line Shapefiles are potential ranges that include the full range of possible structure numbers even though the actual structures may not exist.The search engine included in mojoPortal Content Managment SystemN/AExplains how hydrologic factors interact with phenologyTemperature profile and nutrients data were collected using bottle and CTD casts from DISCOVERY II and another platform in the Mediterranean Sea, Adriatic Sea,and North Atlantic Ocean.

The Knudsen was operated in 3.5 kHz Chirp mode, emitting a 1.5 kHz to 5 kHz (3 kHz bandwidth centered on 3.5 kHz) pulse from transducers mounted in the pod beneath the hull. A record window of 100 or 200 meters and assumed sound velocity of 1500 m/s remained constant through the cruise, except for areas where topographic variation dictated a >200meter record window. The resulting data records were 131 or 261 msec long, with a sample interval 0.038 msec. The ping rate varied over the course of the cruise, generally between 4 and 6 seconds.This dataset is a part of U.S. Geological Survey Central Region Energy Resources Team National Petroleum Reserve, Alaska, Legacy Data Archive. The National Petroleum Reserve, Alaska, (NPRA) Legacy Data Archive represents one of the largest geological and geophysical data sets held by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). From 1944 to 1953 the U.S. Navy operated a large-scale exploration of the then Naval Petroleum Reserve No. 4, drilling 36 test wells and 45 core tests. A second extensive exploration program was operated between 1974 and 1982. Run first by the U.S. Navy and later the USGS, this exploration program collected over 12,000 line miles of seismic data and drilled 28 exploratory wells. Both these exploration programs generated a vast amount of data, analyses, and documents, much of which is presented at http://nerslweb.cr.usgs.gov/. This web site makes available the following data types: SEG-Y format seismic data. Image files of associated seismic data documentation. Tables of seismic data field collection parameters.

The autonomous, ice-based drifting buoys measure, delineate and, importantly, attribute thermodynamically-driven changes in the thickness of the ice cover. Data from the IMBs provide a time series of snow accumulation and ablation, ice growth, ice surface and bottom melt, internal ice temperature fields, and temporally-averaged estimates of ocean heat flux. The IMB buoys are also equipped to measure position, sea level pressure (SLP), and surface air temperature (SAT). The IMBs are deployed strategically and in coordination with other elements of AON to optimize the observation of changes and trends in sea ice throughout the Arctic Basin. The Broader Impacts of this award are many. IMB data have and will continue to assist large-scale modeling efforts to improve the treatment of ice growth and decay in GCMs and to assess the relative impact of ice thermodynamics on the observed changes in the Arctic sea ice cover. Results will also provide baseline data to support the development of instruments and algorithms to remotely sense snow depth, ice thickness, and the onset of freeze-up.Extension, Density, and Calcification data from 35 Porites coral cores covering the entire length of the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Data set contains 35 individual core data sets plus time series 1746-1982 of average calcification rate for 10 of these sites. The Australian Institute of Marine Science began collecting cores from very large massive colonies of Porites on the Great Barrier Reef in the early 1980s. Such cores cannot normally be identified to species. The cores were mounted and sawn to remove slices that were about 6-7mm thick. All slices were X-rayed and skeletal density measured along a central track on each slice using a gamma densitometer. The high density portion of annual density bands in Porites from the Great Barrier Reef appears to form usually between October and March, the Southern Hemisphere summer. Peaks in the density profiles were successively counted backwards from the last (outermost or youngest) peak. Density was assumed to peak in January and the most recent peak was dated from the date of collection of the core. Dates were then assigned to all peaks in the series. Time series of the following skeletal growth parameters were then obtained: 1) Average annual density (g.cm-3) 2) Annual linear extension measured between high density peaks (cm.yr-1) 3) Annual calcification (g.cm-2.yr-1_; the product of annual average density and annual linear extension. These data were obtained from coral cores taken at 35 sites on the Great Barrier Reef. The density profiles do not always display regular, obvious annual peaks and we could not be absolutely sure of the dating for some profiles. We consider there may be errors of + or - 2-3 years in the starting data of some of these series. File AIMS10CoreAvg.txt: Time series of average calcification rate is based on 10 Porites corals for 1746-1982: Jeannie River, Flinders Reef, Brook Island, Britomart Reef, Lodestone Reef, Wheeler Reef, Havannah Island, Hook Island, Sanctuary Reef, and Abraham Reef. 3 series are presented: 1) Annual average values expressed as standardized anomalies; each of the 10 series was converted to standardized anomalies with respect to 1934-1982 mean and sd; resulting series then averaged for 10 corals. 2) Annual average standardized anomales filtered with 5-year gaussian filter. 3) Annual average series converted to original calcification units (g.cm-2.yr-1) filtered with 5-year gaussian filter. Because of potential dating errors the last two series are considered to be most reliable. Lough and Barnes (1997) suggest that ~30% of the variance in the 10-coral calcification series can be explained by variations of annual sea-surface temperature.GWAS Central Studies Web Search Search for G2P studies through GWAS Central.A fault map and digital fault dataset were constructed based on offsets of the basement surface.

However, at most life stages, and in most Willamette River habitats, it is difficult to identify naturally-produced summer-run fish compared to winter-run fish (all hatchery-origin summer steelhead smolts are marked with an adipose clip). As a consequence, it is generally unknown to what extent summer steelhead successfully spawn, how many juveniles are produced, and when and where they reside in the system. In this study, NWFSC's Don VanDoornik uses genetic stock identification (GSI) techniques to identify the stock of origin of steelhead in the Willamette River. The resulting information will be used by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife to guide management of their steelhead hatchery programs in the Willamette River. Steelhead genetic data (microsatellite DNA genotypes)Data were gathered by the R/V Marion Dufresne in May and June of 1992 over the Mascarene Ridge in the Indian Ocean on cruise MD72/MASCAFLUX.

The cores were collected vertically down the axis of maximum growth of the colony. Cores were subsampled into 1mm growth increments, resulting in an average of 12 samples/annual growth increment. These samples were analysed for d18O, then the data interpolated to seasonal resolution (presented here). In this region, seasonal and interannual variations in skeletal d18O are due to the combined effects of changes in precipitation/evaporation balance and temperature; see Tudhope et al., 1995, Earth Planet.

A bi-weekly sampling regime of the hydrology and plankton along a transect over the Continental Shelf starting at Newport. This consistent survey has generated significant information on within year variability in the California Current Marine Ecosystem that has yielded valuable insights into the food web involving juvenile salmon. Parameters collected during this effort are used in forecasts for a number of species, assemblages, and ecosystems. 2. The SAIP work has supported studies of the prey field that juvenile salmon interact with. Some of this data is used in forecasts of juvenile salmon returns, and it is also helping to make possible some preliminary evaluations of hatchery wild interactions and other density-dependent questions.

The descriptions were abstracted from unpublished data reports and Bottom Type "M" log sheets, and digitized from survey smooth sheets produced by the NOAA National Ocean Service (NOS) and its predecessor, the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey (USCGS). Prior to August 2001, many physical sediment samples were routinely sent to the Smithsonian Institution Museum of Natural History (NMNH) for archive with accompanying "M" log forms from which bottom type and other information were coded into the NMNH sediment database. In 2001, NMNH sent a copy of the database to NGDC to be incorporated into the Index to Marine and Lacustrine Geological Samples database, and for distribution to data users needing access to the bottom type information in the files. With support from NOS, NGDC digitized several thousand additional bottom type observations from historic NOS Hydrographic Survey smooth sheets and added them to the database. NOS is coding thousands more bottom type observations for entry into the database from survey Data Reports, or DRs. In 2011, NOS began adding standardized digital bottom type descriptions to the database using the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) SF57 standard "NATSUR" (nature of surface) and "NATQUA" (nature of surface qualifier) coding scheme, transferring the data to NGDC in KML form for archive and upload to the geospatially-enabled database.

The grids include data from all the major ocean basins as well as detailed reconstructions of back-arc basins. The age, spreading rate and asymmetry at each grid node is determined by linear interpolation between adjacent seafloor isochrons in the direction of spreading. Ages for ocean floor between the oldest identified magnetic anomalies and continental crust are interpolated by geological estimates of the ages of passive continental margin segments. The age uncertainties for grid cells coinciding with marine magnetic anomaly identifications, observed or rotated to their conjugate ridge flanks, are based on the difference between gridded age and observed age. The uncertainties are also a function of the distance of a given grid cell to the nearest age observation, and the proximity to fracture zones or other age discontinuities. Asymmetries in crustal accretion appear to be frequently related to asthenospheric flow from mantle plumes to spreading ridges, resulting in ridge jumps towards hotspots. The authors also use the new age grid to compute global residual basement depth grids from the difference between observed oceanic basement depth and predicted depth using two alternative age-depth relationships. The new set of grids helps to investigate prominent negative depth anomalies, which may be alternatively related to subducted slab material descending in the mantle or to asthenospheric flow. A combination of these digital grids and the associated relative and absolute plate motion model with seismic tomography and mantle convection model outputs represent a valuable set of tools to investigate geodynamic problems.WMSThis is a map service for a story map on the Tourism and Recreation and Offshore Minerals sectors of the ocean economy.

The Pollutant Source Identification Project (MB-3) sought to provide a summary and analysis of pollutant loads to Mamala Bay from both point and nonpoint sources. One aspect of the study was the run-off into the ocean from the Ala Wai Canal. For better understanding the processes in the Ala Wai Canal, two 24-hour intensive sampling studies were performed. Measurements included temperature, salinity, water velocity, and various water quality parameters. The field work took place from 25-26 March and 6-7 July 1994.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

Global methane flux from seabed cold seeps has only been estimated for continental shelves, at 8 to 65 Tg CH4 yr 1, yet other parts of marine continental margins are also emitting methane. The US Atlantic margin has not been considered an area of widespread seepage, with only three methane seeps recognized seaward of the shelf break. However, massive upper-slope seepage related to gas hydrate degradation has been predicted for the southern part of this margin, even though this process has previously only been recognized in the Arctic. Here we use multibeam water-column backscatter data that cover 94,000 km2 of sea floor to identify about 570 gas plumes at water depths between 50 and 1,700 m between Cape Hatteras and Georges Bank on the northern US Atlantic passive margin. About 440 seeps originate at water depths that bracket the updip limit for methane hydrate stability. Contemporary upper-slope seepage there may be triggered by ongoing warming of intermediate waters, but authigenic carbonates observed imply that emissions have continued for more than 1,000 years at some seeps. Extrapolating the upper-slope seep density on this margin to the global passive margin system, we suggest that tens of thousands of seeps could be discoverable.The Crustal Ages of the Ocean Floor Poster was created at NGDC using the Crustal Ages of the Ocean Floor database draped digitally over a relief of the ocean floor database. The Crustal Ages of the Ocean Floor database was created by a consortia of marine scientists including Dr. R. Dietmar Muller, Dept. of Geology and Geophysics, University of Sydney, Australia, Dr. Walter R. Roest, Geological Survey of Canada, Ottawa, Canada, Dr. Jean-Yves Royer, Lab. de Geodynamique, Villefranche Sur Mer, France, Dr. Lisa M. Gahagan, Institute for Geophysics, University of Texas, Austin, Texas, and Dr. John G. Sclater, Scripps Institution of Oceanography, La Jolla, California. This version of the age grid is based on the geomagnetic time scale of Cande and Kent (1995) for magnetic anomalies younger than chron 34 (83.5 Ma), and on the time scale from Gradstein et al, (1994) for older times. The grid node interval is 6 arc-minutes using a self- consistent set of global isochrons and associated plate reconstruction poles. The age of each grid node was determined by linear interpolation between adjacent isochrons in the direction of spreading. Ages for ocean floor between the oldest identified magnetic anomalies and continental crust were interpolated by estimating the ages of passive continental margin segments from geological data and published plate models. The gridded ages of the ocean floor are based on a digital set of isochrons. The isochrons are based on a large number of marine magnetic anomaly data, satellite altimetry data, and a self- consistent plate model. The finite rotation poles that the isochrons are based on and the references to the magnetic anomaly and fracture zone data are documented in the: University of Texas Institute for Geophysics Technical Report No. 117, 1992, "A global isochron chart" by J.-Y. Royer, R.D. Muller, L.M. Gahagan, L.A. Lawver, C.L. Mayes, D. Nurnberg, and J.G. Sclater. Digital age and error grids, files of continent-ocean boundaries and present day plate boundaries, a C-program to adapt the grid to new timescales, can be obtained from public ftp sites in North America and Australia.This British Geological Survey (BGS) geophysical survey took place in August 1972 in the Sound of Jura and Irish Sea on board the MV Researcher.

Data was acquired with a pole-mounted Reson 8101 ER multibeam echosounder (240 kHz) and processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS v5.4 software. Data has all correctors applied (attitude, sound velocity) and has been reduced to mean lower low water (MLLW) using final approved tides from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM zone 20 north, datum WGS84. The processed CARIS data was used to generate a CARIS BASE surface based on swath angle with footprint size 3*3. An ASCII XYZ file was exported from the BASE surface and opened in ESRI ArcMap 9 as an XY event. Then the ArcToolbox conversion tool 'Feature to Raster' was used to generate an ESRI Grid of bathymetry. Finally, the Slope calculator within ArcGIS Spatial Analyst/Surface Analysis was used to calculate slope in degrees, using that ESRI Grid of source bathymetry.While the project was conducted to meet IHO Order 2 accuracy standards, there is a roll artifact (averaging 0.5m high) in the dataset that the user should take into consideration when performing any analysis.This georeferenced image represents 5 meter resolution multibeam bathymetry of Buck Island channel, along the north shore of St. Croix, US Virgin Islands.

Within CARIS, an imagery file with associated georeferencing was then exported from the BASE surface.The project was conducted to meet IHO Order 1 and 2 accuracy standards, dependant on the project area and depth. All users should individually evaluate the suitability of this data according to their own needs and standards.This digital data release consists of an ARC/INFO grid and associated INFO tables. The grid is called MUID and has STATSGO (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1994) soil mapping unit identifiers gridded on a 1-kilometer resolution for the conterminous United States. The INFO tables have soil characteristics data in them. The ITEMS in the tables are weighted average values for several soil characteristics in the STATSGO data base. The weighted average values were computed by aggregating the soil layers and components in the data base. The INFO tables are called MUID.LAYER, MUID.COMP, MUID.KFACT, MUID.TFACT, and MUID.WEG. The INFO tables can be related or joined to the MUID grid or to individual State coverages (grids or polygons) of MUIDs. Joining or relating the tables to the MUID grid creates 1-kilometer resolution grids of the soil characteristics for the conterminous United States. The soil characteristics in MUID.LAYER are permeability (PERML and PERMH in the STATSGO data base), available water capacity (AWCL and AWCH), bulk density (BDL and BDH), and organic matter (OML and OMH). The soil characteristics in MUID.COMP are slope (SLOPEL and SLOPEH), depth to seasonally high water table (WTDEPL and WTDEPH), and depth to bedrock (ROCKDEPL and ROCKDEPH). The soil characteristic in MUID.KFACT is the soil erodibility factor (KFACT), the soil characteristic in MUID.TFACT is the soil loss tolerance factor (TFACT), and the soil characteristic in MUID.WEG is the wind erosion group (WEG). The MUID grid and INFO tables were created with a set of arc macro language (aml) and Fortran programs. Send electronic mail to dwolock@usgs.gov to obtain copies of the computer code.

This specific project focused on the development of a plan to spatially and quantitatively characterize the fish communities in relatively shallow waters throughout the Sanctuary (less than 110 ft). This collaboration also included the initial implementation of that plan. The FGBNMS represents the northernmost tropical western Atlantic coral reef on the continental shelf and support the most highly developed offshore hard bank community in the region. The complexity of habitats supports a diverse assemblage of organisms including approximately 250 species of fish, 23 species of coral, and 80 species of algae in addition to large sponge communities. Understanding and monitoring these resources is critical to both sanctuary inventory and management activities.Monitoring of the biological communities has taken place at FGBNMS since the 1970s. This work has focused primarily on monitoring the benthos with video transects and photostations documenting transitions between coral, algae and sponge communities over time. Until relatively recently, little has been done to monitor or characterize the reef fish community. In 1994 the Reef Environmental Education Foundation (REEF) began surveys of the Sanctuary and utilized a combination of REEF personnel, volunteers, and Sanctuary staff to visually census reef fish populations via roving diver surveys. These surveys have been invaluable in terms of species list development and understanding the ranges of these species. Subsequently, a stationary point-count survey technique was utilized to begin to quantify community metrics such as species abundance and trophic structure at selected locations. These data provide an important starting point for characterizing the fish community; however, they are limited in scope of inference to small portions of the Sanctuary coral cap environment and are therefore difficult to utilize in developing population estimates at the scale of the Sanctuary.This file was compiled by the Japan Oceanographic Data Center using the IOC Marine Geological Data Format.

The purpose was to collect data for regional survey of the UK continental Shelf. See Survey 1973/7 for the second phase of the project. A total of 6395km over 91 survey lines were collected during 1973/6 (Lines 1-49) and 1973/7 (Lines 50-91) surveys. Sea floor data were collected using echo sounder and transit sonar. Sub-bottom profiling data were collected using gravity meter; magnetometer; pinger and sparker. The data were recorded as paper records. These data are archived by BGS. Technical details of the survey are contained in BGS report WB/MG/74/48.To support NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program (CRCP) long-term goals for sustainable management and conservation of coral reef ecosystems, towed-diver surveys (aka. towboard surveys) were conducted by the Coral Reef Ecosystem Division (CRED) of the NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC) as part of biennial Pacific Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program (RAMP) Cruises. 4 towboard surveys (7.2872 km in length), were conducted at Laysan Island during the NW Hawaiian Islands RAMP Cruise TC0207 from 8 September - 7 October 2002. Towboard surveys are a good method for obtaining a general description of large reef areas, assessing the status of low-density populations of large-bodied reef fish, large-scale disturbances (e.g., bleaching), general distribution and abundance patterns of macro-invertebrates (e.g., COT, giant clams), and for assessing trends in these populations and metrics. A pair of scuba divers (1 fish and 1 benthic diver) are towed 60 m behind a small survey launch at a speed of 1-2 knots and a depth of approximately 15m. Each survey is 50 min long, covers about 2 km of habitat, and is divided into ten 5-minute survey segments. The fish diver records, to the lowest possible taxon, all large-bodied reef fishes (>50cmTL) seen within 5m either side and 10m in front of the towboard. Length of each individual is estimated to the nearest cm. The fish towboard is also outfitted with a forward-facing digital video camera to record the survey swath. The benthic diver records percent cover of coral and macroalgae, estimates benthic habitat type and complexity, and censuses a suite of benthic macroinvertebrates including Crown of Thorns sea stars and sea urchins. The benthic towboard is equipped with a downward-facing digital still camera which images the benthos at 15 second intervals. These images are analyzed for percent cover of coral, algae, and other benthic components. Both towboards are equipped with SEABIRD SBE-39 temperature/depth sensors set to record at 5 second intervals. Latitude and longitude of each survey track is recorded at 15 second intervals using a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver onboard the tow boat. A layback algorithm is applied to more accurately map the position of the divers with respect to the reef environment. This algorithm calculates the position of the divers based on the position of the tow boat taking into account the length of the tow rope, the depth of the divers, and the curvature of the survey track. This metadata applies to the benthic characterization observations.This data set contains lidar point data (Geodetic Coordinates) from a strip of Southern California coastline (including water, beach, cliffs, and top of cliffs) from Long Beach to the US/Mexico border. The data set was created by combining data collected using an Optech Inc. Airborne Laser Terrain Mapper (ALTM) 1225 in combination with geodetic quality Global Positioning System (GPS) airborne and ground-based receivers. The Bureau of Economic Geology, the University of Texas at Austin owns and operates an ALTM 1225 system (serial number 99d118). The system was installed in a twin engine Partenavia P-68 (tail number N6602L) owned and operated by Aspen Helicopter, Inc. The lidar data set described by this document was collected on 28-30 September 2004; Julian Days 27204, 27304, and 27404 (see Lineage, Source_Information, Source_Contribution for pass information). 99d118 instrument settings for these flights were; laser pulse rate: 25kHz, scanner rate: 26Hz, scan angle: +/- 20deg, beam divergence: narrow, altitude: 950-1150m AGL, and ground speed: 90-132kts. Settings were different on final day of surveying due to low clouds and flight restrictions: beam divergence: wide, altitude: 320-620m AGL, and ground speed: 101-121kts. Three GPS base stations (Seal Beach, Dana Point, and Point Loma, see Lineage, Source_Information, Source_Contribution for coordinates) were operating during the survey. Data represented is all points including terrain, vegetation, and structures. This data also contains returns from the water surface. No processing has been done to remove returns from terrain, vegetation, structures or water surfaces.Version 3.0 of the NFHP Data System consists of data access and visualization tools and underlying data management tools and functions.

These maps are developed utilizing Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery, and can be used to track changes in the landscape through time. This trend information gives important feedback to managers on the success or failure of management policies and programs and aid in developing a scientific understanding of the Earth system and its response to natural and human-induced changes. This understanding allows for the prediction of impacts due to these changes and the assessment of their cumulative effects, helping coastal resource managers make more informed regional decisions. NOAA C-CAP is a contributing member to the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics consortium and C-CAP products are included as the coastal expression of land cover within the National Land Cover Database.Sidescan sonar image, surficial geologic interpretation, and bathymetry of the Long Island Sound sea floor.This data set includes data collected in 1999 after Hurricane Dennis and before Hurricane Floyd along the outer banks of North Carolina. Laser beach mapping uses a pulsed laser ranging system mounted onboard an aircraft to measure ground elevation and coastal topography. The laser emits laser beams at high frequency and is directed downward at the earth's surface through a port opening in the bottom of the aircraft's fuselage. The laser system records the time difference between emission of the laser beam and the reception of the reflected laser signal in the aircraft. The aircraft travels over the beach at approximately 60 meters per second while surveying from the low water line to the landward base of the sand dunes.powered by the HUBzero(R) Platform for Scientific CollaborationN/AThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

NOAA is responsible for archiving and distributing the source data as described in this metadata record.This dataset contains an ESRI Grid representing the slope (in degrees) of the bathymetry of the south shore of St. John, including a portion of the NPS's Virgin Islands Coral Reef National Monument in the US Virgin Islands, based on a 1m bathymetric grid. Due to the large file size of the 1m St. John grid, it was divided into four component grids for improved manageability, named stj04_1_1rug, stj04_1_2rug, stj04_1_3rug, and stj04_1_4rug from west to east.NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Team and NOAA/NOS/OCS/HSD personnel, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory, federal, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data in the US Virgin Islands from 2/18/04 to 3/5/04. Data was acquired with a pole-mounted Reson 8101 ER multibeam echosounder (240 kHz) and processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS v5.4 software. Data has all correctors applied (attitude, sound velocity) and has been reduced to mean lower low water (MLLW) using final approved tides from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM zone 20 north, datum WGS84. The processed CARIS data was used to generate a CARIS BASE surface based on swath angle with footprint size 3*3. An ASCII XYZ file was exported from the BASE surface and opened in ESRI ArcMap 9 as an XY event. Then the ArcToolbox conversion tool 'Feature to Raster' was used to generate an ESRI Grid of bathymetry. Finally, the Slope calculator within ArcGIS Spatial Analyst/Surface Analysis was used to calculate slope in degrees, using that ESRI Grid of source bathymetry.While the project was conducted to meet IHO Order 2 accuracy standards, there is a roll artifact (averaging 0.5m high) in the dataset that the user should take into consideration when performing any analysis.Five trace elements with human-health concerns were detected at high concentrations: arsenic, boron, fluoride, molybdenum, and strontium. Chromium was detected at moderate concentrations.The authors present four companion digital models of the age, age uncertainty, spreading rates and spreading asymmetries of the world's ocean basins as geographic and Mercator grids with 2 minute resolution. The grids include data from all the major ocean basins as well as detailed reconstructions of back-arc basins. The age, spreading rate and asymmetry at each grid node is determined by linear interpolation between adjacent seafloor isochrons in the direction of spreading. Ages for ocean floor between the oldest identified magnetic anomalies and continental crust are interpolated by geological estimates of the ages of passive continental margin segments. The age uncertainties for grid cells coinciding with marine magnetic anomaly identifications, observed or rotated to their conjugate ridge flanks, are based on the difference between gridded age and observed age. The uncertainties are also a function of the distance of a given grid cell to the nearest age observation, and the proximity to fracture zones or other age discontinuities. Asymmetries in crustal accretion appear to be frequently related to asthenospheric flow from mantle plumes to spreading ridges, resulting in ridge jumps towards hotspots. The authors also use the new age grid to compute global residual basement depth grids from the difference between observed oceanic basement depth and predicted depth using two alternative age-depth relationships. The new set of grids helps to investigate prominent negative depth anomalies, which may be alternatively related to subducted slab material descending in the mantle or to asthenospheric flow. A combination of these digital grids and the associated relative and absolute plate motion model with seismic tomography and mantle convection model outputs represent a valuable set of tools to investigate geodynamic problems.Near-real-time maps of location, ground motion, and shaking intensity of earthquakes in California and Nevada for the past hour, past day, and past week and links to other earthquake information.WMS Service for RGIS dataset Rio Grande Channel, Northern Mesilla Valley, NM, before 1844 (8186ef0e-c7af-4002-9759-1c3432db4758)Consistent, historic, and up-to-date ground-water data, such as water levels collected at wells and springs, are available from the USGS National Water Information System as graphs, tables, or files to download.Counts of primarily planktonic foraminifera from Dr. W.F.

NOAA supports continual scientific research of the wreck for the sake of advancing knowledge of in situ preservation and degradation rate. Throughout its endeavors with Titanic, NOAA intends to promote full participation with other federal agencies, and academic and research institutions with respect to exploration and research of the wreck site. An eleven-day cruise to the Titanic wreck site will be conducted aboard the Russian science vessel R/V Akademik Mstislav Keldysh in conjunction with Deep Ocean Expeditions (DOE). A majority of the cruise time will be allocated to Jim Cameron?s staff for filming purposes. However, NOAA Office of Ocean Exploration (OE) has acquired two days of operation time with use of the vessel?s MIR submersibles.This georeferenced image represents 5 meter resolution bathymetry of an offshore portion of the NPS's Virgin Islands Coral Reef National Monument, south of St. John, US Virgin Islands. NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Team, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory, federal, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data in the US Virgin Islands from 2/1/05 to 2/12/05.

Hydrographic survey data primarily consist of water depths, but may also include features (e.g. rocks, wrecks), navigation aids, shoreline identification, and bottom type information. NOAA is responsible for archiving and distributing the source data as described in this metadata record.Scientific DataA digital elevation model (DEM) of a portion of the Mississippi and Alabama barrier islands, post-Hurricane Gustav (September 2008 hurricane), was produced from remotely sensed, geographically referenced elevation measurements cooperatively by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National Park Service (NPS), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Elevation measurements were collected over the area using the Experimental Advanced Airborne Research Lidar (EAARL), a pulsed laser ranging system mounted onboard an aircraft to measure ground elevation, vegetation canopy, and coastal topography. The system uses high-frequency laser beams directed at the Earth's surface through an opening in the bottom of the aircraft's fuselage. The laser system records the time difference between emission of the laser beam and the reception of the reflected laser signal in the aircraft. The plane travels over the target area at approximately 50 meters per second at an elevation of approximately 300 meters, resulting in a laser swath of approximately 240 meters with an average point spacing of 2-3 meters. The EAARL, developed originally by NASA at Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia, measures ground elevation with a vertical resolution of +/-15 centimeters. A sampling rate of 3 kilohertz or higher results in an extremely dense spatial elevation dataset. Over 100 kilometers of coastline can be surveyed easily within a 3- to 4-hour mission. When subsequent elevation maps for an area are analyzed, they provide a useful tool to make management decisions regarding land development.

The observations were made by two radiometers (from Radiometer Physics GmbH) that are time-synced. This dataset contains only sky brightness temperatures; however, these data can be used to retrieve precipitable water vapor, cloud liquid water path, and profiles of temperature in the boundary layer. These radiometers periodically collect elevation scan data (horizon to horizon) that will be used to improve accuracy of the retrieved temperature profiles and to use for in-field calibrations (via tip-curve analysis). The radiometers are calibrated using liquid nitrogen approximately 4 times per year. The raw data are converted into netCDF format.

Because of the market value of these species, each fish is individually weighed and recorded as the vessels are being unloaded. Vessels and/or dealers that have federal permits for these two fisheries are required to submit the information from these sales receipts (tally sheets) to the Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC). This program began as a research project conducted by researchers associated with universities. In 1994, the National Marine Fisheries Service began to manage the collection and processing of these data. Although swordfish are the primary commercial species caught and recorded individually on the sales receipts, the weights of other species were also listed on the tally sheets. Prior to 1985, the weigh-out data for the other (non-swordfish) species were not recorded. Beginning in 1986, the SEFSC began to enter the individual carcass weights for all species listed on the tally sheets. The data in this data set include the following; a unique code for each vessel that lands these species and report to the SEFSC, date of landing, state and port landed, code of the dealer purchasing the catch, gear fished, data source, location code of general fishing area, total hooks fished, days of actual fishing, total number of sets, and a species code along with the individual carcass weights for each species. All records from a specific trip are identified by their respective vessel codes and date of landing. Prior to 1986, effort (hooks, days fished, number of sets) information was recorded from personal vessel logbooks voluntarily submitted by vessel captains/owners. Beginning in 1986, all pelagic longline vessels that actively fished are required to submit daily logbook set records for each trip. Based upon this information, fishing effort is determined and, subsequently, added to the domestic longline database.Climatic atlas dated 1985, in Mongolian, with introductory material also in Russian and English.

The primary objective of the Benthic Surveillance Project was to quantify concentrations of a suite of organic and inorganic contaminants in the livers of fish and surficial sediments from selected sites in the coastal and estuarine waters of the United States. In addition, the levels of certain indicators of the biological effects of these contaminants were measured. Incidences of visible lesions, including fin erosion, have been noted and histopathological examinations of various tissues have been carried out. Originally histopathological examinations determined the prevalence of any identifiable disease conditions in samples of liver, kidney, and gill tissue.In addition the Benthic Surveillance Project analyzed fish liver tissue sample for cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A) activities in liver via analysis for aryl hydrocarbon hydrolase (ahh). The induction of hepatic CYP1A activity is one of the earliest physiological changes detected after exposure to chemical contaminants. A number of studies have shown that measurement of these biochemical alterations combined with measurement of the above-mentioned injuries, give a more consistent assessment of contaminant exposure in indigenous fish that do single bioeffects measurements.DebianEX1201 is the 2012 shakedown mission of NOAA ship Okeanos Explorer (EX) and will perform system patch tests of the vessel s Kongsberg EM302 multibeam sonar.

The imagery will be collected during optimum viewing conditions whenever possible, however maximizing flight mission time is also a major priority. Ideal flying conditions would be during spring and fall seasons when tree and foliage cover is reduced, thus optimizing the viewing accuracy of roadway centerlines. Other factors affecting image quality can be sun angle, haze, wind speed, turbulence and cloud cover. The flight missions are also prioritized to capture certain PSAP (Public Safety Answering Point) areas ahead of other counties; However once again, weather conditions dictate where and when the flight crew can collect data.Certain image anomalies will be visible within the mosaics. These small warpages were addressed during the digitizing phase by using imagery imported from other stages of the process. It is the intent of NDDOT to eventually address all of these anomalies but at this stage of the project, production speed is a higher priority.Pixel size is approximately 0.9-feet, data is processed to UTM-14, NAD83The Base Map missions are created at a flight height above ground (HAG) of 9,000' (2743.2 meters) which creates imagery with a .90'(27.432 cm) ground sample distance (GSD).

The purpose was to collect data as part of the UK continental shelf survey programme. The objective was to survey the St. Kilda sheet and part of the Little Minch sheet. Sea floor data were collected using echosounder and sidescan sonar. Sub-bottom seismic profiling data were collected using Airgun, Pinger and Sparker. Gravity and Magnetometer data were recorded. These records are archived by BGS. Technical details of the survey data are contained in BGS report WB/89/6R.This dataset is a record of fish distribution and activity for SUMMER CHINOOK contained in the StreamNet database. This feature class was created based on linear event data extracted from the StreamNet database on March 21, 2006. Distribution is based upon the best professional judgement of local fish biologists, in the Pacific Northwest Region (Oregon, Washington, and Idaho). These data were collected by biologists at the state fish & wildlife agencies of Washington (WDFW), Oregon (ODFW) and Idaho (IDFG). Data were then compiled by StreamNet staff into paper maps or event tables at the state level. These event tables were submitted to the StreamNet regional staff at Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commision (PSMFC) where this regional distribution feature class was created from the source route event tables. All data is referenced to the PNW 1:100,000 River Reach Hydrography (http://www.streamnet.org/pnwr/pnwrhome.html) on the LLID-based stream routing system.U.S.V.I. relative erosion rate by land cover type (2000)Includes: UTM zones, BLM Administrative Boundaries, Urban Areas, Counties, 100K quadrangle boundaries, Major Roads, US Highways, Interstates, State boundaries.

An orthoimage is remotely sensed image data in which displacement of features in the image caused by terrain relief and sensor orientation have been mathematically removed. Orthoimagery combines the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map. Each orthoimage provides imagery over a 5000-foot by 5000-foot block on the ground. There is no image overlap between adjacent files. The projected coordinate system is Georgia State Plane West (FIPS 1002) feet with a NAD83 datum.Data showing ocean uses patterns in the Kawaihae-Keahole region of Hawaii Island and the Honolua-Wahikuli region of Maui Island. Data compiled from a series of participatory ocean use mapping workshops held in 2010 and 2011. Data provide use patterns showing general use areas and dominant use or hotspot areas.This data set is a digital soil survey and generally is the most detailed level of soil geographic data developed by the National Cooperative Soil Survey. The information was prepared by digitizing maps, by compiling information onto a planimetric correct base and digitizing, or by revising digitized maps using remotely sensed and other information. This data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and computerized attribute data. The map data are in a soil survey area extent format and include a detailed, field verified inventory of soils and miscellaneous areas that normally occur in a repeatable pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at the scale mapped. A special soil features layer (point and line features) is optional. This layer displays the location of features too small to delineate at the mapping scale, but they are large enough and contrasting enough to significantly influence use and management. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the National Soil Information System relational database, which gives the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

The CFSR was designed and executed as a global, high resolution, coupled atmosphere-ocean-land surface-sea ice system to provide the best estimate of the state of these coupled domains over this 31-year period. The CFSR has also been extended as an operational, real time product into the future. New features of the CFSR include: (1) coupling of atmosphere and ocean during the generation of the 6 hour guess field; (2) an interactive sea-ice model; and (3) assimilation of satellite radiances by the Grid-point Statistical Interpolation (GSI) scheme over the entire period. The CFSR global atmosphere resolution is approximately 38 km (T382) with 64 levels extending from the surface to 0.26 hPa. The global ocean's latitudinal spacing is 0.25 deg at the equator, extending to a global 0.5 deg beyond the tropics, with 40 levels to a depth of 4737m. The global land surface model has four4 soil levels and the global sea ice model has 3 layers. The CFSR atmospheric model has observed variations in carbon dioxide (CO2) over the 1979-2009 period, together with changes in aerosols and other trace gases and solar variations. Most available in-situ and satellite observation data were included in the CFSR. Satellite-based radiance observations were bias corrected with spin-up runs at full resolution, taking into account variable CO2 concentrations. This procedure enabled smooth transitions of the observation record due to evolutionary changes in satellite observing systems. The CFSR atmospheric, oceanic and land surface output products are available at an hourly time resolution and at a 0.5 deg x 0.5 deg latitude and longitude resolution. In total, there are 10 data products available from the National Climatic Data Center that make up the CFS Reanalysis collection: MON - Monthly Means; TIME - Parameter Timeseries; PGB - 3-D Pressure Level Data; FLX - Surface and Radiative Fluxes; OCN - 3-D Ocean Data; IPV - 3-D Isentropic Level Data; DIAB - 3-D Diabatic Heating Data; GRBLOW - Low-Resolution Data; HIC - High-Res Initial Conditions; LIC - Low-Res Initial Conditions. All data are in GRIB-2 format, except for the initial condition data which are in native binary formats. Total CFSR data volume is approximately 200 TB.WMSThe nowCOAST 'forecasts' Web Map Service (WMS) provides layers containing gridded weather and oceanographic surface forecast products from the NOAA/NWS National Digital Forecast Database (NDFD).

Includes links to related memos, training, software, projects, and referencesThis project is a cooperative effort between the National Ocean Service, National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science, Center for Coastal Monitoring and Assessment, the University of Hawaii, and Analytical Laboratories of Hawaii, LLC. The goal of the work was to develop coral reef mapping methods and compare benthic habitat maps generated by photointerpreting georeferenced color aerial photography, hyperspectral and IKONOS satellite imagery. The enhanced spectral resolution of hyperspectral and control of bandwidths of multispectral data yield an advantage over color aerial photography particularly when coral health and time series analysis of coral reef community structure are of interest. Depending on the type of instrument, a spectral imaging system can be utilized to see multiple colors from ultraviolet through the far infrared range. The AURORA hyperspectral imaging system collected 72 ten nm bands in the visible and near infrared spectral range with a 3 meter pixel resolution. The data was processed to select band widths, which optimized feature detection in shallow and deep water. Photointerpreters can accurately and reliably delineate boundaries of features in the imagery as they appear on the computer monitor using a software interface such as the Habitat Digitizer.TIGER, TIGER/Line, and Census TIGER are registered trademarks of the Bureau of the Census. The Redistricting Census 2000 TIGER/Line files are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the Census TIGER data base. The geographic coverage for a single TIGER/Line file is a county or statistical equivalent entity, with the coverage area based on January 1, 2000 legal boundaries. A complete set of Redistricting Census 2000 TIGER/Line files includes all counties and statistically equivalent entities in the United States and Puerto Rico. The Redistricting Census 2000 TIGER/Line files will not include files for the Island Areas. The Census TIGER data base represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts. However, each county-based TIGER/Line file is designed to stand alone as an independent data set or the files can be combined to cover the whole Nation. The Redistricting Census 2000 TIGER/Line files consist of line segments representing physical features and governmental and statistical boundaries. The Redistricting Census 2000 TIGER/Line files do NOT contain the ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) and the address ranges are of approximately the same vintage as those appearing in the 1999 TIGER/Line files. That is, the Census Bureau is producing the Redistricting Census 2000 TIGER/Line files in advance of the computer processing that will ensure that the address ranges in the TIGER/Line files agree with the final Master Address File (MAF) used for tabulating Census 2000. The files contain information distributed over a series of record types for the spatial objects of a county. There are 17 record types, including the basic data record, the shape coordinate points, and geographic codes that can be used with appropriate software to prepare maps. Other geographic information contained in the files includes attributes such as feature identifiers/census feature class codes (CFCC) used to differentiate feature types, address ranges and ZIP Codes, codes for legal and statistical entities, latitude/longitude coordinates of linear and point features, landmark point features, area landmarks, key geographic features, and area boundaries. The Redistricting Census 2000 TIGER/Line data dictionary contains a complete list of all the fields in the 17 record types.A software model for regional interpretation of water-quality monitoring data, estimating origin and fate of contaminants in streams, with documentation, publications and data for the applications.WMSSearch IFAExplains why and how water from this reservoir, and others like it, sometimes acquire undesirable taste or odor, yet are not dangerous to drink.Update on daily streamflow conditions and drought situation in New Jersey.This data set consists of land cover derived from high resolution imagery according to the Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) protocol.

Digital Imagery Captured from Videotapes Recorded during 2001 Clelia Submersible Dives to the Oculina Banks Deep Sea Coral Reefs. The data presented in the Oculina Banks Geographic Information System (OGIS) was collected as part of a cooperative project between: the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Undersea Research Program, NOAA Fisheries (also primary sponsor of OGIS), NOAA Ocean Service, NOAA Ocean Exploration Program, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)-- Coastal and Marine Geology Program, Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution (HBOI) and Florida State University. An Oculina Geographic Information System (OGIS) provides a comprehensive, interactive data source for the Oculina Banks Habitat Area of Particular Concern (OHAPC), a marine protected area off the east coast of Florida in 70 to 120 meters of water depth. Data layers include; multi-beam bathymetry, single-beam bathymetry, sidescan mosaics, sediment analyses, resulting interpretative maps of habitat types, video and still imagery from submersible (human occupied and remotely operated vehicles) dive transects and point counts (fish and habitat cover), and dive narratives. This metadata record relates to images captured from videotapes recorded during the 2001 "Islands in the Stream" Expedition, on fourteen "Clelia" submersible dives.WMSThe National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is a comprehensive set of digital spatial data that encodes information about naturally occurring and constructed bodies of surface water (lakes, ponds, and reservoirs), paths through which water flows (canals, ditches, streams, and rivers), and related entities such as point features (springs, wells, stream gages, and dams). The information encoded about these features includes classification and other characteristics, delineation, geographic name, position and related measures, a "reach code" through which other information can be related to the NHD, and the direction of water flow. The network of reach codes delineating water and transported material flow allows users to trace movement in upstream and downstream directions. In addition to this geographic information, the dataset contains metadata that supports the exchange of future updates and improvements to the data. The NHD is available nationwide in two seamless datasets, one based on 1:24,000-scale maps and referred to as high resolution NHD, and the other based on 1:100,000-scale maps and referred to as medium resolution NHD. Additional selected areas in the United States are available based on larger scales, such as 1:5,000-scale or greater, and referred to as local resolution NHD. The NHD supports many applications, such as making maps, geocoding observations, flow modeling, data maintenance and stewardship.

The Northeast Snowfall Impact Scale (NESIS) developed by Paul Kocin of The Weather Channel and Louis Uccellini of the National Weather Service characterizes and ranks high-impact Northeast snowstorms. These storms have large areas of 10 inch snowfall accumulations and greater. NESIS has five categories: Extreme, Crippling, Major, Significant, and Notable. The index differs from other meteorological indices in that it uses population information in addition to meteorological measurements. Thus NESIS gives an indication of a storm's societal impacts. NESIS scores are a function of the area affected by the snowstorm, the amount of snow, and the number of people living in the path of the storm. The aerial distribution of snowfall and population information are combined in an equation that calculates a NESIS score which varies from around one for smaller storms to over ten for extreme storms. The raw score is then converted into one of the five NESIS categories. The largest NESIS values result from storms producing heavy snowfall over large areas that include major metropolitan centers. For details on how NESIS scores are calculated at the National Climatic Data Center, see Squires and Lawrimore (2006).The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

They show ground conditions at the times they were collected. A digital orthophoto is a raster image of remotely sensed data in which displacement in the image due to sensor orientation and terrain relief have been removed. Orthophotos combine the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map. The primary digital orthophotoquad (DOQ) is a 1-meter ground resolution, quarter-quadrangle (3.75-minutes of latitude by 3.75-minutes of longitude) image cast on the Universal Transverse Mercator Projection (UTM) on the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). The geographic extent of the DOQ is equivalent to a quarter-quad plus overedge. The overedge ranges a minimum of 50 meters to a maximum of 300 meters beyond the extremes of the primary and secondary corner points. The overedge is included to facilitate tonal matching for mosaicking and for the placement of the NAD83 and secondary datum corner ticks. The normal orientation of data is by lines (rows) and samples (columns). Each line contains a series of pixels ordered from west to east with the order of the lines from north to south. The standard, archived digital orthophoto is formatted as four ASCII header records, followed by a series of 8-bit binary image data records. The radiometric image brightness values are stored as 256 gray levels ranging from 0 to 255.

In fall 1992 and spring 1993 we drilled an unusual big colony of Porites sp. at the fore-reef at Aqaba. The colony is situated in front of the reef edge of the fringing reef south of the Marine Science Station. The colony grows from a depth of ca 4.5 m, reaches a height of 3.5 m and a maximum diameter of approximately 5.5 m. We drilled with a hand held pneumatic drill powered by compressed air from a Scuba tank. We used a conventional 30cm diamond-tipped drill bit and in order to obtain longer cores we constructed extensions of 100cm each (3 in total). The extensions are made from a 17mm diameter steel rod with a screw thread attached either to the core barrel or another extension. Up to 320 cm long cores in 30cm lengths with 100% recovery were obtained. The core holes were filled with cement plugs after drilling to prevent bioerosion (see Hudson 1981; Winter et al. 1991) . The cores were drilled parallel to the growth axis (perpendicular to the coral surface). Five cores were extracted from the "big" Porites sp. at different sides of the colony. Three cores (19, 20, 21) are of 130 cm length, core 24 (lying SE-side of the colony at an angle of 45) reached 229 cm length, and core 18 (top of the colony) recovered coral skeleton to a total length of 312 cm. For oxygen and carbon isotope analysis core 18 (top of colony) and core 19 (horizontal core from the southern side) were selected. Samples for isotopic analyses were treated with 35% hydrogen peroxide for 24 hours to remove oxidizable organic material. In addition they were rinsed several times in demineralized water and dried in a stove at 40C. Small samples to determine the average isotope composition of each year were cut with a hand held saw. They were taken along the edge of the coral slabs. The top of LD-bands was chosen as the end (respectively beginn ing) of an annual band. In all our samples this boundary is sharp and can be determined relatively precisely. Each chip was gently powdered in an agate mortar. The samples were reacted with 100% H3PO4 at 75C in an online, automated carbonate reaction device (Kiel Device) connected to a Finnigan Mat 252 mass spectrometer. Isotopic ratios were corrected for 17-O contribution (Craig 1957) and are reported in permil relative to PDB. Average precision based on duplicate sample analysis and on multiple analysis of NBS 19 is 0.04 permil for d13C and 0.08 permil for d18O.This CD-ROM contains a digital version of the Geologic Map of the United States, originally published at a scale of 1:2,500,000 (King and Beikman, 1974b).

Seafloor bathymetric data acquired with multibeam sonars are used for a wide range of fundamental research applications (e.g. on active seafloor geologic processes, bottom water circulation, biological habitats), as well as for more applied needs (e.g. marine resource management, tsunami inundation, submarine navigation). However these data have been acquired for only a small fraction of the oceans and typically require specialist knowledge to process. The GMRT is the only global-scale compilation of these data, providing access to grids and images to the full native resolution of the data, as well as attribution to the original data sources and is intended for broad use for research and education. The GMRT also serves the terrestrial community by providing easy access to images or grids from NASA s ASTER terrestrial elevation data (30-m resolution) for the globe and the USGS National Elevation Dataset (NED) (10-m resolution) for portions of the US. New source swath sonar data are obtained from NOAA s NGDC and other sources, and are evaluated, cleaned, edited, and then merged into the multi-resolution DEM. The GMRT synthesis is provided as a service of the IEDA:MGDS with funding from the U.S. National Science Foundation. Collaboration with Google has resulted in publication of the GMRT multibeam content in Google Earth. Further details on the architecture of the GMRT are available in Ryan et al.

The NAIP acquires digital ortho imagery during the agricultural growing seasons in the continental U.S.. A primary goal of the NAIP program is to enable availability of ortho imagery within one year of acquisition. The NAIP provides two main products: 1 meter ground sample distance (GSD) ortho imagery rectified to a horizontal accuracy within +/- 5 meters of reference digital ortho quarter quads (DOQQ's) from the National Digital Ortho Program (NDOP) or from the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP); 1 meter GSD ortho imagery rectified within +/- 6 meters to true ground. The tiling format of NAIP imagery is based on a 3.75' x 3.75' quarter quadrangle with a 300 meter buffer on all four sides. The NAIP imagery is formatted to the UTM coordinate system using the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). The NAIP imagery may contain as much as 10% cloud cover per tile. The quarter quads have been reprojected from UTM 11 or UTM 12 to IDTM83 projection (ESPG 102605), mosaicked into 100k tiles, and compressed using ERDAS Imagine for use in ArcGIS.The National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) established the Coastal-Marine Automated Network (C-MAN) for the National Weather Service in the early 1980's. NDBC has installed approximately 50 C-MAN stations on lighthouses, at capes and beaches, on near shore islands, and on offshore platforms. NDBC has deployed over 100 moored (a.k.a., weather) buoys in coastal and offshore waters from the western Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean around Hawaii, and from the Bering Sea to the South Pacific. C-MAN and moored buoy data typically include barometric pressure, wind direction, speed and gust, and air temperature; however, some C-MAN stations are equipped to also measure seawater temperature, water level, waves, and relative humidity. Moored buoys measure wave energy spectra from which NDBC derives significant wave height, dominant wave period, and average wave period. In addition, many moored buoys measure the direction of wave propagation. In collaboration, NDBC and the National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) are archiving these data from C-MAN and moored buoys. This NODC Accession is part of the collaboration and it contains netCDF (version 4) files with the data collected during February 2012.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

The positions of these CORS sites help define the National Spatial Reference System (NSRS). NGS defines and manages the NSRS - the framework for latitude, longitude, height, scale, gravity, orientation and shoreline throughout the U.S. The NSRS provides a consistent national coordinate system to support mapping, charting, navigation, boundary determination, property delineation, infrastructure development, resource evaluation surveys, and scientific applications. The CORS system enables positional accuracies that approach a few centimeters relative to the NSRS, both horizontally and vertically. While every effort is made to retain data in the original at-sampling rate, there may be cases where only the 30-second decimated rate data exists.

Site: Santa Cruz Island, Galapagos (90 deg 30 min W, 0 deg 45 min S).(Version 4.1, updated September 13, 2013) Maritime limits for the United States are measured from the U.S. baseline, recognized as the low-water line along the coast as marked on NOAA's nautical charts in accordance with the articles of the Law of the Sea. The baseline and related maritime limits are reviewed and approved by the interagency U.S. Baseline Committee. The primary purpose of this dataset is to update the official depiction of these maritime limits and boundaries on NOAA's nautical charts. The Office of Coast Survey depicts on its nautical charts the territorial sea (12 nautical miles), contiguous zone (24nm), and exclusive economic zone (200nm, plus maritime boundaries with adjacent/opposite countries). U.S. maritime limits are ambulatory and subject to revision based on accretion or erosion of the charted low water line.

These boundaries are included with this dataset for continuity.An earthquake is the motion or trembling of the ground produced by sudden displacement of rock in the Earth's crust. Earthquakes result from crustal strain, volcanism, landslides, and collapse of caverns. Earthquakes can affect hundreds of thousands of square kilometers; cause damage to property measured in the tens of billions of dollars; result in loss of life and injury to hundreds of thousands of persons; and disrupt the social and economic functioning of the affected area. This set of slides provides an overview and summary of effects caused by 11 earthquakes in eight countries. The images show surface faulting, landslides, soil liquefaction, and structural damage.Stress accumulates in response to tectonic forces until it exceeds the strength of the rock. The rock then breaks along a preexisting or new fracture called a fault. The rupture extends outward in all directions along the fault plane from its point of origin (focus). The rupture travels in an irregular manner until the stress is relatively equalized. If the rupture disturbs the surface, it produces a visible fault. Earthquakes can affect hundreds of thousands of square kilometers; cause damage to property measured in the tens of billions of dollars; result in loss of life and injury to hundreds of thousands of persons; and disrupt the social and economic functioning of the affected area. Although earthquakes in the United States occur most frequently in states west of the Rocky Mountains, devastating earthquakes have also occurred in the Midwest and East. All 50 states have some degree of risk from earthquakes. Earthquakes can be measured in terms of either the amount of energy they release (magnitude) or the degree of ground shaking they cause at a particular locality (intensity). Magnitude is calculated from the record (wave amplitude) made by an earthquake on a calibrated seismograph. The magnitude scale is logarithmic. An increase of one in magnitude represents a tenfold increase in the recorded wave amplitude. However, the energy release associated with an increase of one in magnitude is not tenfold, but about thirty fold. For example, approximately 900 times more energy is released in an earthquake of magnitude 7 than in an earthquake of magnitude 5. Intensity is determined from observations of the earthquake's effect on people, structures, and the earth's surface at a given locality. When a fault ruptures, seismic waves propagate outward in all directions and ground shaking results. Generally the severity of ground shaking increases as magnitude increases and decreases as distance from the fault rupture increases. The severity of the ground shaking can be enhanced by certain soil and subsoil types. The intensity of the earthquake is affected by the severity of the ground shaking, the duration of the shaking, the response of structures in the affected area, etc. Hazards associated with earthquakes include ground shaking, surface faulting, earthquake-induced ground failures, tectonic uplift and subsidence, and tsunamis. Surface faulting, the offset of the earth's surface by differential movement across a fault, shears and tears structures built on the fault. Surface faulting is generally accompanied by horizontal or vertical distortion of the earth's surface that can distort or tilt structures constructed near the fault. Regional uplift and subsidence may accompany earthquakes caused by large displacements on shallow faults. Such changes can damage harbor facilities, canals, roads, railroads, and other structures. A tsunami is a water wave or a series of waves generated by an impulsive vertical displacement of the surface of the ocean or other body of water by an earthquake or other cause. These waves can extend the damaging effects of an earthquake event thousands of kilometers from the earthquake focus. Ground failures accompanying earthquakes include landslides, liquefaction, lateral spreads, differential settlements, and ground cracks. Earthquake shaking often dislodges rock and debris on steep slopes, triggering rock falls, avalanches, and landslides. These slides have been known to bury entire towns and may be the most damaging aspect of the earthquake event. Liquefaction occurs where ground water is near the surface in soils composed of sands and silts. The soil temporarily loses strength and behaves as a viscous liquid. Structures can settle or tip in the liquefied soil or be ripped apart as the ground spreads laterally or flows. Flow failures can move over kilometers at speeds of tens of kilometers per hour. They usually develop in loose, saturated sand on slopes greater than five percent. When subsurface sand layers lose strength because of liquefaction, lateral spreading can occur in overlying sediments allowing them to move down even the gentlest slopes. Soils may lose shear strength allowing heavy structures to settle or tip and lightweight, buried structures to rise buoyantly. Cracking may result from movement along faults, differential compaction of the soil, or slides. Strong ground shaking has compacted loose cohesionless materials and caused differential ground settlements ranging from 5 cm to more than a meter. Many of these earthquake effects are depicted in the slides included in this set.Direct measurement of an important indicator of interannual variability is extended, using geological proxy measures, farther back in time to well before modern measurements were made.

URVCOMP.TXT Site: Urvina Bay, Galapagos Islands, 00 deg 24.52 min S, 91 deg 14.04 min W. Oxygen Isotopic time series averaged from 2 cores-UR-86 (Pavona clavus, 1607-1953) and UR-87 (Pavona gigantea, 1962-1981). This data was used to construct figure 8 in the original reference. Years with no value are years for which no coral sample was available for analysis. Both samples are expressed in units of parts per mil relative to the PDB standard. To construct a working composite of the two data sets, a correction must be made for the species-specific offset between P. Clavus and P. Gigantea. Based on our studies in Galapagos (e.g., Fig 6 in Dunbar, et al, 1994) and multiple sites in the eastern Pacific (Wellington and Dunbar, Coral Reefs, in press), P. Clavus produces aragonite about 0.40 parts per mil enriched in O-18 relative to P. Gigantea. This amount has been added to the UR-87 PDB values to produce Figure 8 in Dunbar, et al, 1994. B. URV87.DAT This data was used to construct Figure 5 in the annual reference, a sub-annual oxygen isotopic time-series spanning the period 1961-1982. The data are sub-annual del O-18 values, given in parts per mil relative to the PDB standard, from a colony of Pavona gigantea. The coral was drilled at roughly millimeter intervals; the first columns of file URV87.DAT give the distance of the top and bottom of the sample interval from the base of the colony. The column labeled Year is the inferred calendar period of growth for each interval.Does remote-sensing information, such as that from Landsat and similar Earth-observing satellites, provide economic benefits to society, and can this value be estimated?The NGDC Seafloor Sediment Geotechnical Properties Database contains test engineering properties data coded by students at NGDC from primarily U.S. Naval Oceanographic Office laboratory reports, but also from data reports generated by NOAA's Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML).

The Australian Institute of Marine Science began collecting cores from very large massive colonies of Porites on the Great Barrier Reef in the early 1980s. Such cores cannot normally be identified to species. The cores were mounted and sawn to remove slices that were about 6-7mm thick. All slices were X-rayed and skeletal density measured along a central track on each slice using a gamma densitometer. The high density portion of annual density bands in Porites from the Great Barrier Reef appears to form usually between October and March, the Southern Hemisphere summer. Peaks in the density profiles were successively counted backwards from the last (outermost or youngest) peak. Density was assumed to peak in January and the most recent peak was dated from the date of collection of the core. Dates were then assigned to all peaks in the series. Time series of the following skeletal growth parameters were then obtained: 1) Average annual density (g.cm-3) 2) Annual linear extension measured between high density peaks (cm.yr-1) 3) Annual calcification (g.cm-2.yr-1_; the product of annual average density and annual linear extension. These data were obtained from coral cores taken at 35 sites on the Great Barrier Reef. The density profiles do not always display regular, obvious annual peaks and we could not be absolutely sure of the dating for some profiles. We consider there may be errors of + or - 2-3 years in the starting data of some of these series. File AIMS10CoreAvg.txt: Time series of average calcification rate is based on 10 Porites corals for 1746-1982: Jeannie River, Flinders Reef, Brook Island, Britomart Reef, Lodestone Reef, Wheeler Reef, Havannah Island, Hook Island, Sanctuary Reef, and Abraham Reef. 3 series are presented: 1) Annual average values expressed as standardized anomalies; each of the 10 series was converted to standardized anomalies with respect to 1934-1982 mean and sd; resulting series then averaged for 10 corals. 2) Annual average standardized anomales filtered with 5-year gaussian filter. 3) Annual average series converted to original calcification units (g.cm-2.yr-1) filtered with 5-year gaussian filter. Because of potential dating errors the last two series are considered to be most reliable. Lough and Barnes (1997) suggest that ~30% of the variance in the 10-coral calcification series can be explained by variations of annual sea-surface temperature.Information on porphyry copper deposits from around the world with grade and tonnage models, a general classification based on geologic setting, mineralogy, with data allowing locations of these deposits to be plotted using GIS.The National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) established the Coastal-Marine Automated Network (C-MAN) for the National Weather Service in the early 1980's. NDBC has installed approximately 50 C-MAN stations on lighthouses, at capes and beaches, on near shore islands, and on offshore platforms. NDBC has deployed over 100 moored (a.k.a., weather) buoys in coastal and offshore waters from the western Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean around Hawaii, and from the Bering Sea to the South Pacific. C-MAN and moored buoy data typically include barometric pressure, wind direction, speed and gust, and air temperature; however, some C-MAN stations are equipped to also measure seawater temperature, water level, waves, and relative humidity. Moored buoys measure wave energy spectra from which NDBC derives significant wave height, dominant wave period, and average wave period. In addition, many moored buoys measure the direction of wave propagation. In collaboration, NDBC and the National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) are archiving these data from C-MAN and moored buoys.Powered by the HUBzero(R) Platform for Scientific CollaborationSources and effects of contamination surrounding a single well in western ConnecticutSearch Stack Overflow: Q for professional and enthusiast programmersGateway to useful USGS websites for recreation in nature watching and exploring, boating, camping, climbing, fishing, hiking, biking, and hunting, with links to maps, real-time streamflow, geology, photos, and plant and animal information.WMSThis data consists of the complete set of the KootenaiCounty Assessor's Office parcel assessment maps.

This count of every resident in the United States was mandated by Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution and all households in the U.S. and individuals living in group quarters were required by law to respond to the 2010 Census questionnaire. The data collected by the decennial census determine the number of seats each state has in the U.S. House of Representatives and is also used to distribute billions in federal funds to local communities. The questionnaire consisted of a limited number of questions but allowed for the collection of information on the number of people in the household and their relationship to the householder, an individual's age, sex, race and Hispanic ethnicity, the number of housing units and whether those units are owner- or renter-occupied, or vacant. The first wave of results for sub-state geographic areas in New Mexico was released on March 15, 2011, through the Redistricting Data (PL94-171) Summary File. This batch of data covers the state, counties, places (both incorporated and unincorporated communities), tribal lands, school districts, neighborhoods (census tracts and block groups), individual census blocks, and other areas. The Redistricting products provide counts by race and Hispanic ethnicity for the total population and the population 18 years and over, and housing unit counts by occupancy status. The 2010 Census Redistricting Data Summary File can be used to redraw federal, state and local legislative districts under Public Law 94-171. This is an important purpose of the file and, indeed, state officials use the Redistricting Data to realign congressional and state legislative districts in their states, taking into account population shifts since the 2000 Census. More detailed population and housing characteristics will be released in the summer of 2011. The data in these particular RGIS Clearinghouse tables are for all Block Groups in Lea County. There are two data tables. One provides total counts by major race groups and by Hispanic ethnicity, while the other provides proportions of the total population for these same groups.

The IFCA standard operating procedure for surveying small fish is used (a copy of this document is held by the IFCA) and the methodology conforms with the Water Framework Directive (Directive 2000/60/EC) and the Centre for Environment and Fisheries and Aquaculture (Cefas) advice for surveying juvenile Bass. Two survey methods are used; a beach seine and a 1.5m or a 2m beam trawl. All fish caught are identified to species level. The first 50 of each fish species are measured (total length from snout to tip of tail) with the remainder being counted. In addition fork length is measured for bass, and for all bass greater than 21cm a scale sample is taken for age determination. The surveys are always conducted at slack water and at similar tidal heights. Additional information recorded includes; Water analysis (temperature, salinity, specific conductivity, dissolved oxygen (percentage and mg/L), pH and Redox value), tidal state, tidal height, persons present, fish identifier and meteorological information. The data is currently stored in excel spreadsheets. The objective of monitoring small fish is to develop a time series of relative abundance in the near shore habitats (areas which are commonly utilised by juvenile fish as nursery grounds). The information collected has many applications e.g. to monitor abundance over time, to investigate responses to specific events or to investigate the growth rate of a species.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

This survey was designed to repeat previous work carried out by the Natural History Museum (NHM) in order to provide information on the condition of the SAC. Data for the survey was gathered using divers moving along a transect line making video recordings fo the biotopes. The dataset includes GIS biotope polygon data of the Thanet coast and a comparrison with previous data found in 1997 and 2004 by the NHM.WMSExtension, Density, and Calcification data from 35 Porites coral cores covering the entire length of the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Data set contains 35 individual core data sets plus time series 1746-1982 of average calcification rate for 10 of these sites. The Australian Institute of Marine Science began collecting cores from very large massive colonies of Porites on the Great Barrier Reef in the early 1980s. Such cores cannot normally be identified to species. The cores were mounted and sawn to remove slices that were about 6-7mm thick. All slices were X-rayed and skeletal density measured along a central track on each slice using a gamma densitometer. The high density portion of annual density bands in Porites from the Great Barrier Reef appears to form usually between October and March, the Southern Hemisphere summer. Peaks in the density profiles were successively counted backwards from the last (outermost or youngest) peak. Density was assumed to peak in January and the most recent peak was dated from the date of collection of the core. Dates were then assigned to all peaks in the series. Time series of the following skeletal growth parameters were then obtained: 1) Average annual density (g.cm-3) 2) Annual linear extension measured between high density peaks (cm.yr-1) 3) Annual calcification (g.cm-2.yr-1_; the product of annual average density and annual linear extension. These data were obtained from coral cores taken at 35 sites on the Great Barrier Reef. The density profiles do not always display regular, obvious annual peaks and we could not be absolutely sure of the dating for some profiles. We consider there may be errors of + or - 2-3 years in the starting data of some of these series. File AIMS10CoreAvg.txt: Time series of average calcification rate is based on 10 Porites corals for 1746-1982: Jeannie River, Flinders Reef, Brook Island, Britomart Reef, Lodestone Reef, Wheeler Reef, Havannah Island, Hook Island, Sanctuary Reef, and Abraham Reef. 3 series are presented: 1) Annual average values expressed as standardized anomalies; each of the 10 series was converted to standardized anomalies with respect to 1934-1982 mean and sd; resulting series then averaged for 10 corals. 2) Annual average standardized anomales filtered with 5-year gaussian filter. 3) Annual average series converted to original calcification units (g.cm-2.yr-1) filtered with 5-year gaussian filter. Because of potential dating errors the last two series are considered to be most reliable. Lough and Barnes (1997) suggest that ~30% of the variance in the 10-coral calcification series can be explained by variations of annual sea-surface temperature.WMSNortek 600kHz Aquadopp acoustic current profilers were deployed between March 2010 and April 2011 on shallow water moorings located in Vieques Sound, Puerto Rico, and Virgin Passage USVI.

The dataset spans from 1981 to 10 days from the present, and is processed from the AVHRR Global Area Coverage (GAC) Level 1b dataset. AVHRR GAC observations are packaged into data arrays with latitude and longitude dimensions of 3600 x 7200 covering the globe at 0.05 degree spatial resolution. The Version 4 Land Surface CDR products were produced by the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) and the University of Maryland. Changes for version 4 from version 3 include 1) added data from NOAA-16 and NOAA-17 extending the time period, 2) improved geolocation accuracy from use of OLE instead of TLE, 3) center of the grid is used as the reference, and 4) data value of a grid cell is computed as an average of available good observations. This CDR is used as an input to other Land Surface CDR products including the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Leaf Area Index (LAI) and the Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR). The product was converted from HDF to netCDF-4 with CF metadata, and is accompanied by algorithm documentation, data flow diagram and source code for the NOAA CDR Program.Dynamic network of business schools and management development professionals that facilitates learning, accreditation, debate and exchange on best practicesLinks to online data retrieval, information on MTBE and gasoline oxygenates, VOCs analysis, VOC publications, news features, and featured online publications.Describes and provides links to USGS research in the location of the estuary and coast of Long Island, New York, to map the sea floor and to study sediment transport, contaminants, and sand resources and coastal vulnerability.The USGS Shaded Relief Large service from The National Map (TNM) was created from the National Elevation Dataset (NED), a seamless dataset of best available raster elevation data for the conterminous United States, Alaska, Hawaii, and Territorial Islands of the US. Derived from the NED using a hill shade technique, this base map represents a continental view showing shaded relief from USGS NED layers at resolutions of 1/3-, 1-, and 2-arc-second (in Alaska only). This hillshade is actually five separate shaded relief datasets created from the original terrain data. Each shaded relief has different azimuths and altitude values as follows: 0 45, 135 60, 270 45, 315 45, 45 45. These five datasets are then combined into one feature class using map algebra to compute the raster layers using the following equation (shadedrelief1 + shadedrelief2 + shadedrelief3 + (shadedrelief4 x 2) + shaded relief5 / 6). This equation gives double importance to the 315 degrees azimuth and 45 degrees altitude. Color characteristics are the result of applying a color ramp in which RGB values range from near-white (RGB: 255, 255, 252) to brown (RGB: 156, 142, 107). The color ramp was applied with a stretch type of 4.3 standard deviations, since the scale of brightness values range from 130 to 1240. Contrast (24 percent) and brightness (3 percent) enhancements were applied for cartographic purposes.

Continuous acoustic, sonar-backscatter data convey information about physical properties of the seabed, and hence could be a valuable addition to that suite of variables. The potential utility of acoustic backscatter was tested for improving habitat models of marine species using data from a pilot sidescan-sonar survey conducted from 28 June to 3 July 2002 in the Bristol Bay region of the eastern Bering Sea (EBS). Raw digital backscatter data were processed with QTC SIDEVIEW and CLAMS software to objectively segment bedform based on statistical analysis of the echograms. Resultant acoustic variables - Q-values (Q1, Q2, and Q3)-, representing the first three principal components of the data derived from image analysis of backscatter echoes, and a complexity metric (compx) measuring the variance of Q-values in a geographic area - were used in multiple linear regression to model individual species abundance from bottom-trawl survey data.Search -gcube-wiki (en)The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

Elevation measurements were collected over the area using the NASA Experimental Advanced Airborne Research Lidar (EAARL), a pulsed-laser ranging system mounted onboard an aircraft to measure ground elevation, vegetation canopy, and coastal topography. The system uses high-frequency laser beams directed at the Earth's surface through an opening in the bottom of the aircraft's fuselage. The laser system records the time difference between emission of the laser beam and the reception of the reflected laser signal in the aircraft. The plane travels over the target area at approximately 50 meters per second at an elevation of approximately 300 meters. The EAARL, developed by NASA at Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia, measures ground elevation with a vertical resolution of 15 centimeters. A sampling rate of 3 kilohertz or higher results in an extremely dense spatial elevation dataset. Over 100 kilometers of coastline can be easily surveyed within a 3- to 4-hour mission. When subsequent elevation maps for an area are analyzed, they provide resource managers with a useful tool regarding land development.

The quake was felt over 500,000 square miles. The quake took 131 lives and caused $350-500 million in property damage (One hundred twenty-two of the deaths were attributed to the tsunami.) The area of the damage zone (50,000 square miles) and the duration of the quake (3 to 4 minutes) were extraordinary. This set of slides shows geologic changes, damage to structures, transportation systems, and utilities and tsunami damage. It features the effects of four major landslides in Anchorage during the 1964 event. Certainly the quake would have claimed many more lives had the population not been sparse, the weather clement, and had the quake not occurred during the off-season for fishing and on the evening of a holiday when the schools were empty and most offices deserted.Geologic Changes - The quake was accompanied by vertical displacement of earth over a 100,000 square mile region. The maximum uplift recorded was 33 feet (10 m) on land, and as much as 50 feet (15 m) on the sea floor. Subsidence exceeded 7 feet (2 m). The uplift destroyed or greatly impaired the usefulness of many harbors. The habitats of many animals, trees and other vegetation were destroyed or damaged by subsidence. Low-lying settlements and many miles of railroad and highway were dropped below the level of high tide so that they were periodically flooded and attacked by storm waves. Crustal deformation associated with this earthquake was the most extensive ever recorded and extended far beyond the epicentral area. Faulting of bedrock at the earth's surface during the earthquake was found only in the area of maximum tectonic uplift on southwest Montague Island in Prince William Sound and on the sea floor southwest of Montague Island. No faulting at the surface was found in the zone between the areas that were tectonically uplifted and downdropped. Grabens (elongated down-dropped blocks between faults) formed in many places. The strong ground motion induced many snowslides, rockfalls, and subaerial and subaqueous landslides. Large subaerial slides in Anchorage and subaqueous slides at Valdez and Seward damaged streets, buildings, utilities, and shore side structures. Numerous slope and embankment failures harmed railways, highways, and particularly bridges. Rock avalanches and snow avalanches, subsidence, and consolidation occurred; and cracks, fissures, and sand spouts developed in many places. Soil liquefaction played a major roll in the development of most landslides.Damage To Structures, Transportation, and Utilities - Anchorage, Cordova, Homer, Kodiak, Seldovia, Seward, and Valdez were damaged severely by uplift or subsidence, shaking, landslides, tsunamis, and fires. In Anchorage damaging landslides occurred in Turnagain, Fourth Avenue, "L" Street, and Government Hill areas. Structural damage was largely the result of landslides. Seismic vibration caused severe structural damage in Anchorage, Valdez, and the large delta of the Coper River. Damage from seismic vibration was most common in buildings and structures constructed of heavy materials and tended to be most severe in tall buildings. Notable among the partly or completely collapsed buildings in Anchorage were the Four Seasons apartment building, the Government Hill School, and the J.C. Penney building. However, many of the heavy structures in these areas sustained minimal seismic damage. Generally well-built wood-frame buildings of seismic resistant design sustained very little damage from vibration generated by the earthquake. Valdez was severely damaged by a large submarine landslide and the resulting waves that destroyed the waterfront facilities. The ground beneath the town was deformed damaging the foundations of structures. The town was moved to a new site at a cost of $37,500,000.Damage to surface transportation facilities was extensive. Landslides, embankment failures, subsidence of ground, tsunami action, and soil movements that distorted or destroyed bridges were the main causes of damage. The Alaska Railroad lost its port facility at Whittier, its docks at Seward, and numerous bridges on the Kenai Peninsula. Reconstruction of the railroad facilities was completed in two and one half years at a cost of $22 million. Many highway bridges, especially on the Seward and Copper River highways, were damaged. Many port and harbor facilities, especially at Seward, Valdez, Kodiak, Whittier, Cordova, and Homer, were destroyed. The major damage to utilities occurred in Anchorage where the earth slides set in motion by the earthquake caused extensive damage to all utility systems. Oil storage tanks at Valdez, Seward, and Whittier ruptured and burned.Tsunamis - The submarine landslides resulting from the earthquake created local sea waves or tsunamis, which, together with the major tsunami generated by the crustal deformation, smashed port and harbor facilities, disturbed and killed salmon fry, leveled forests, and caused the saltwater invasion of many coastal freshwater lakes. In addition to the local tsunamis the earthquake generated a major tsunami that was recorded throughout the Pacific Basin and lapped against Antarctica. The major tsunami caused extensive damage outside Alaska in Port Alberni British Columbia and took 16 lives in Oregon and California. Of the one hundred twenty-two deaths resulting from the tsunamis, at least 71 deaths were blamed on the local slump-generated tsunamis in Alaska. The quake also generated seiches in rivers, harbors, channels, lakes, and swimming pools as distant as the United States Gulf Coast States. Total tsunami damage amounted to about $84 million in Alaska.This dataset contains a comma-delimited ASCII XYZ text file with easting, northing, and depth in meters values for the bathymetry of selected portions of seafloor around St. Croix, St. Thomas, and St. John in the US Virgin Islands, derived from data collected in 2005.

Towboard surveys) are conducted by the Coral Reef Ecosystem Division (CRED) of the NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC) as part of biennial Pacific Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program (RAMP) Cruises. These cruises support NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program (CRCP) long-term goals for sustainable management and conservation of coral reef ecosystems. 6 towboard surveys (12.4723 km in length), were conducted at Laysan Island in the NW Hawaiian Islands from 1 September - 4 October 2006 as part of RAMP Cruise HI0611. Towboard surveys are a good method for obtaining a general description of large reef areas, assessing the status of low-density populations of large-bodied reef fish, large-scale disturbances (e.g., bleaching), general distribution and abundance patterns of macro-invertebrates (e.g., COT, giant clams), and for assessing trends in these populations and metrics. A pair of scuba divers (1 fish and 1 benthic diver) are towed 60 m behind a small survey launch at a speed of 1-2 knots and a depth of approximately 15m. Each survey is 50 min long, covers about 2 km of habitat, and is divided into ten 5-minute survey segments. The fish diver records, to the lowest possible taxon, all large-bodied reef fishes (>50cmTL) seen within 5m either side and 10m in front of the towboard. Length of each individual is estimated to the nearest cm. The fish towboard is also outfitted with a forward-facing digital video camera to record the survey swath. The benthic diver records percent cover of coral and macroalgae, estimates benthic habitat type and complexity, and censuses a suite of benthic macroinvertebrates including Crown of Thorns sea stars and sea urchins. The benthic towboard is equipped with a downward-facing digital still camera which images the benthos at 15 second intervals. These images are analyzed for percent cover of coral, algae, and other benthic components. Both towboards are equipped with SEABIRD SBE-39 temperature/depth sensors set to record at 5 second intervals. Latitude and longitude of each survey track is recorded at 15 second intervals using a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver onboard the tow boat. A layback algorithm is applied to more accurately map the position of the divers with respect to the reef environment. This algorithm calculates the position of the divers based on the position of the tow boat taking into account the length of the tow rope, the depth of the divers, and the curvature of the survey track. This metadata applies to the fish biomass observations.This shapefile shows the location of vegetation sampling plots used for vegetation classification and mapping at George Washington Birthplace National Monument.Armorhead (Pseudopentaceros wheeleri) larvae and juveniles were collected in the vicinity of the Northwest and Southeast Hancock Seamounts During 1984 and 1985. Plankton was sampled using a 1 m2 , three-net Tucker trawl, with oblique tows from 0-200 m during all cruises, and neuston samples (0-1 m) in February. In January 1988, seven oblique tows from 0-50 or 0-100 m were taken with a 60-cm, non-closing bongo net, and ten neuston tows at 0-1 m were taken with a 0.49-m2 Manta (neuston) net. All nets had 0.333-mm mesh. Pseudopentaceros larvae and juveniles were removed from the samples at sea and placed in 70% ethanol. Specimens of large juvenile and adult Pseudopentaceros were examined to obtain information on development at greater sizes and, with specimens of additional species, to confirm identifications. Measurements to the nearest 0.01 mm were taken approximately 7 yrs after collection with an ocular micrometer in a dissection microscope, and counts of fin elements and head spines were made using the same microscope, all by Bruce C.

Eighty-nine volcanoes with eruptive phases in the Quaternary are mapped as points centered in the active caldera or volcano summit. Volcanoes with a number of satellite vents and/or cones distributed around the main caldera or summit are given a unique identifier so it is clear that geothermal activity is likely to be found away from the point on the map. Different volcanic morphologies (Strato, Composite, Sheild) and eruptive histories are not noted in the digital data set, though this information was originally included in the Motyka et al. publication.This data set comprises a portion of the Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI) data for Aleutians East Borough and Aleutians West Coastal Resource Service Area (CRSA). These data identify the marine and coastal environments and wildlife.

The vector data file is included in "Geology_OffshoreSaltPoint.zip," which is accessible from http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/781/OffshoreSaltPoint/data_catalog_OffshoreSaltPoint.html. The morphology and the geology of the Offshore of Salt Point map area result from the interplay between local sea-level rise, sedimentary processes, oceanography, and tectonics. The offshore part of the map area extends from the shoreline to water depths of about 90 to 100 m on the mid-continental shelf; the shelfbreak occurs about 20 km farther offshore at water depths of about 200 m. The nearshore and inner shelf (to water depths of about 50 to 60 m) typically dips seaward about 1.0 to 1.5 degrees; the mid to outer shelf dips more gently, generally less than 0.5 degrees. Sea level has risen about 125 to 130 m over about the last 21,000 years (for example, Lambeck and Chappell, 2001; Peltier and Fairbanks, 2005), leading to broadening of the continental shelf, progressive eastward migration of the shoreline and wave-cut platform, and associated transgressive erosion and deposition. Land-derived sediment was carried into this dynamic setting, then subjected to full Pacific Ocean wave energy and strong currents before deposition or offshore transport. Tectonic influences impacting shelf morphology and geology are related to local faulting, folding, uplift, and subsidence (see below). Bedrock of the Eocene and Paleocene German Rancho Formation (unit Tgr) underlies much of the inner shelf, extending to water depths of as much as 60 m. Although onshore coastal outcrops of this unit are well bedded, seafloor outcrops imaged on high-resolution bathymetry have a hackly surface texture and abundant fractures. Embayments in the outer margin of the seafloor bedrock outcrops are commonly paired with the mouths of coastal watersheds and are inferred to have formed by fluvial erosion during the last sealevel lowstand. One of the more prominent embayments occurs about one kilometer north of Salt Point at the mouth of Miller Creek (fig. 1-2). These coastal watersheds are relatively small and steep, extending to a drainage divide just 2 to 3 km east of the shoreline, and are inferred sources of coarse-grained sediments. Immediately east of this onshore topographic divide, drainage along this part of the coast is captured by the northwest-flowing South Fork of the Gualala River (fig. 1-2), which runs parallel to the coast along the trace of the San Andreas fault. Given relatively shallow water depths (0 to about 50 m) and exposure to high wave energy, modern nearshore to mid-shelf sediments are mostly sand (unit Qms) and a mix of sand, gravel, and cobbles (units Qmsc and Qmsd). The more coarse-grained sands and gravels (units Qmsc and Qmsd) are primarily recognized on the basis of bathymetry and high backscatter. Both Qmsc and Qmsd typically have abrupt landward contacts with bedrock (unit Tgr) and form irregular to lenticular exposures that are commonly elongate in the shore-normal direction. Contacts between units Qmsc and Qms are typically gradational. Unit Qmsd forms erosional lags in scoured depressions that are bounded by relatively sharp and less commonly diffuse contacts with unit Qms horizontal sand sheets. These depressions are typically a few tens of centimeters deep and range in size from a few 10's of sq m to more than one sq km. Similar unit Qmsd scour depressions are common along this stretch of the California coast (see, for example, Cacchione and others, 1984; Hallenbeck and others, 2012) where surficial offshore sandy sediment is relatively thin (thus unable to fill the depressions) due to both lack of sediment supply and to erosion and transport of sediment during large northwest winter swells. Such features have been referred to as "rippled-scour depressions" (see, for example, Cacchione and others, 1984) or "sorted bedforms" (see, for example, Goff and others, 2005; Trembanis and Hume, 2011). Although the general areas in which both unit Qmsd scour depressions and surrounding mobile sand sheets occur are not likely to change substantially, the boundaries of the individual Qmsd depressions are likely ephemeral, changing seasonally and during significant storm events. The offshore decrease in slope at mid-shelf water depths (about 60 m) approximately coincides with a transition to more fine-grained marine sediments (unit Qmsf), which extends to the outer (3-nautical-mile) limit of California's State Waters. Unit Qmsf consists primarily of mud and muddy sand and is commonly extensively bioturbated. These fine-grained sediments are inferred to have been derived from from the Russian River, which has its mouth about 15 km south of the map area. Both Drake and Cacchione (1985) and Sherwood and others (1994) have documented seasonal, mid-shelf, northwest-directed, bottom currens capable of transporting fine-grained, suspended sediment from the Russian River to the Offshore of Salt Point map area. Map unit polygons were digitized over underlying 2-meter base layers developed from multibeam bathymetry and backscatter data (see Bathymetry--Offshore Salt Point, California and Backscattter--Offshore Salt Point, California, DS 781, for more information). The bathymetry and backscatter data were collected between 2006 and 2010.

Classes 1, 2, and 7 are defined in accordance with the American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS) classification standards, while classes 11 and 14 are classes specific to the NOAA Digital Coast Data Access Viewer (DAV).These data were collected with a RIEGL VQ-480 airborne lidar system along the Lake Michigan shoreline. Data coverage generally extends along the shoreline from the waterline to 500 meters onshore. The VQ-480 sensor has a pulse repetition rate of 150 kHz at near infrared laser wavelength. Native lidar data are not generally in a format accessible to most Geographical Information Systems (GIS). Specialized in-house and commercial software packages are used to process the native lidar data into 3-dimensional positions that can be exported to standard formats and imported into GIS software for visualization and further analysis. Horizontal positions, provided in Geographic Coordinates in decimal degrees, are referenced to the NAD83 (2011) Epoch 2010 datum. Vertical elevations in meters are also referenced to this datum (GRS80 ellipsoidal height). The 3-D position data are sub-divided into a series of LAS files. The National Geodetic Surveys (NGS) GEOID03 model is used to transform the vertical positions from ellipsoid to orthometric heights referenced to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88). The 3-D position data are sub-divided into a series of LAS files, each covering approximately 5 kilometers of shoreline. Note: The NOAA Coastal Services Center was unable to determine the exact dates of collection due to corrupt GPS times in at least of the LAS files.

XYZ values are derived from a 5m resolution gridding process.NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Team, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory, federal, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data in the US Virgin Islands from 2/1/05 to 2/12/05. Data was acquired with a pole-mounted Reson 8101 ER multibeam echosounder (240 kHz) and processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS v5.4 software. Data has all correctors applied (attitude, sound velocity) and has been reduced to mean lower low water (MLLW) using final approved tides from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM zone 20, datum NAD83. The processed CARIS data was used to generate a CARIS BASE surface based on swath angle. A comma delimited ASCII XYZ file was then exported from the BASE surface.The project was conducted to meet IHO Order 1 and 2 accuracy standards, dependant on the project area and depth. All users should individually evaluate the suitability of this data according to their own needs and standards.The Office of the National Geodetic Survey has produced a series of high-resolution gravimetric geoid models, hybrid geoid models, and associated deflection of the vertical products for the United States. The gravimetric geoid models are referred to the Geodetic Reference System of 1980 (GRS80), situated in the most recent IGS reference frame . The hybrid geoid models and associated deflection of the vertical models refer to the NAD 83 datum, and are used as a transformation between NAD 83 and NAVD 88. Major geoid products were released in 1990, 1993, 1996, 1999, 2003, 2006, 2009, and 2012. Each release represents an improvement in accuracy over the previous models but, more specifically, represents an improved tie to the spatial reference information existing on bench marks archived in the NGS database at the time they were generated. Hence, NAD 83 and NAVD 88 coordinate information collected and processed in 2003 are consistent with the GEOID03 model. Whereas recently collected data are more consistent with GEOID12A. The newest (2012) products are (1) USGG2012, a gravimetric geoid model, (2) GEOID12A, a hybrid geoid model. A GEOID12 model existed briefly but was replaced with GEOID12A when defects were found in control data used to determine GEOID12. These were fixed and a GEOID12A model released. USGG2012 converts between IGS08 (2005.0) and a geopotential surface built upon the underlying EGM2008 (separate product developed by NGA) reference geoid height model for all regions (conterminous US (CONUS), Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico/Virgin Islands, Guam & the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), and American Samoa). GEOID12A converts between NAD 83 (2011.0) and NAVD 88 for CONUS and Alaska only, between NAD 83 (PA11) and the local vertical datums in Hawaii, and American Samoa, and NAD 83 (MA11) and the local vertical datums in Guam and CNMI. Within CONUS, most users should use GEOID12A. It is constructed specifically to relate GPS ellipsoid heights in the NAD 83 datum (epoch 2011.0) and orthometric heights in the NAVD 88 datum including those in the Gulf Coast Subsidence Regions where Vertical Time Dependent Positioning is employed to determine NAVD 88 heights. These are the datums used in many maps and charts, and most applications require that consistency. GEOID12A also exists for Alaska to provide a transformation between NAD 83 and NAVD 88 - where it is available. NAVD 88 coverage in Alaska is not complete and may not be suitable for all regions. For some scientific applications, use of USGG2012 is appropriate (for water flow and height transfer). However, NAVD 88 remains the official vertical datum approved for use in charting and surveying. No NAVD 88 coverage exists in Hawaii, so GEOID12A converts between the same geopotential surface determined for USGG2012 and NAD 83 (PA11).Guam, CNMI, American Samoa, Puerto Rico (PR), and the U.S. Virgin Islands (VI) all have their own separate vertical datums distinct from NAVD 88. GEOID12A converts between the appropriate local version of NAD 83 and the respective vertical datums for each of these regions. The GEOID12A product comprises eight files for the conterminous US, four files for Alaska, and one each for Hawaii, PR/VI, American Samoa, and Guam/CNMI. Single grids also are available for CONUS and Alaska. Each file contains geoid heights on a one minute by one minute grid in both big-endian and little-endian binary (PC compatible) formats. The INTG program is supplied at the download site to interpolate to a specific position within these grids. Another program, XNTG, is supplied to extract subsets and convert the grids between ASCII and binary. Both are in FORTRAN, are available compiled and as source code, and can byte-swap the grids if needed on a Unix platform. There is also an on-line geoid computational facility within the NGS Geodetic Tool Kit at http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/TOOLS. Similar files, programs, and on-line computational facilities exist for USGG2012, USDOV2012 and DEFLEC12A99. USDOV2012 and DEFLEC12A are Deflection of the Vertical models that describe the angular difference between the normal (plumblines) to the ellipsoid and vertical datum. USDOV2012 was determined from USGG2012, while DEFLEC12A was determined from GEOID12A. Hence, USDOV2012 is in IGS08 (2005.0 ), and DEFLEC12A is in NAD 83 (2011/PA11/MA11). See the GEOID section of the NGS Web site at http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/GEOID. Geoid and deflection of the vertical models for Mexico and the Caribbean were computed in 1997 and are distributed as MEXICO97, DMEX97, CARIB97, and DCAR97 respectively. Note, however, these models are largely superseded by the GGM10 model developed by INEGI in Mexico. All geoid products covered here are considered valid inside the U.S. and its territories only. Geoid height values, especially for GEOID12A, are valid within national boundaries. Canada and Mexico are sovereign nations with their own national height systems. For other areas outside of the above models or other national interests, the EGM2008 model exists as a highly accurate global reference model. NGS also offers technical information concerning the construction of the geoid models and practical information concerning its use on the NGS web site at http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/GEOID. NGS also offers a workshop concerning GPS derived heights and the use of the geoid models to convert from GPS derived heights to orthometric heights (see http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/PC_PROD/WorkShops/).WFS Service for RGIS dataset NM Gross Receipts Baseline (f2c36661-3e0d-4511-8943-80e77fa6c7bd)This accession contains pressure, temperature, and salinity values collected from 188 CTD casts between the periods of May 27, 1999 to December 15, 1999.

Block Groups (BGs) are clusters of blocks within the same census tract. Each census tract contains at least one BG, and BGs are uniquely numbered within census tracts. BGs have a valid code range of 0 through 9. BGs have the same first digit of their 4-digit census block number from the same decennial census. For example, tabulation blocks numbered 3001, 3002, 3003,.., 3999 within census tract 1210.02 are also within BG 3 within that census tract. BGs coded 0 are intended to only include water area, no land area, and they are generally in territorial seas, coastal water, and Great Lakes water areas. Block groups generally contain between 600 and 3,000 people. A BG usually covers a contiguous area but never crosses county or census tract boundaries. They may, however, cross the boundaries of other geographic entities like county subdivisions, places, urban areas, voting districts, congressional districts, and American Indian / Alaska Native / Native Hawaiian areas.

NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Team and NOAA/NOS/OCS/HSD personnel, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory, federal, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data in the US Virgin Islands from 2/18/04 to 3/5/04. Data was acquired with a pole-mounted Reson 8101 ER multibeam echosounder (240 kHz) and processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS v5.4 software. Data has all correctors applied (attitude, sound velocity) and has been reduced to mean lower low water (MLLW) using final approved tides from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM zone 20 north, datum WGS84. Within CARIS, each line of backscatter data was evaluated for bottom tracking and was slant-range corrected. Data was not corrected for gain or transmit power artifacts. Backscatter mosaics were then created using the CARIS shine-through option. Finally, a georeferenced imagery file was exported from the mosaic. While the project was conducted to meet IHO Order 2 accuracy standards, there is a roll artifact (averaging 0.5m high) in the dataset that the user should take into consideration when performing any analysis.We estimated a mean of 448 billion cubic feet of potential technically recoverable unconventional natural gas in this area.Physical and profile oceanographic data were collected aboard the ENDEAVOR in the Gulf of Mexico from 2010-06-17 to 2010-06-30 in response to the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill event on April 20, 2010, by the Subsurface Monitoring Unit (SMU), which consisted of multiple government and corporate agencies.

Collectors included George Boehlert, James Uchiyama, Robert Humphreys, Randolph Chang, Alan Everson, Victor Honda, Bert Kikkawa, Raymond Clarke, Thomas Kazama, and Michael Seki. Two locations were sampled intensively during these cruises; one location was over the seamount summit ("seamount" location); the other location was 20 km west, over a water depth of approximately 1,800-4,750 m ("reference" location). Ichthyoplankton was sampled with an opening-closing Tucker trawl equipped with three nets and a double-release mechanism operated by messengers. The nets were 0.333 mm mesh (Nitex) with a 1.4 m2 mouth area. Ship speed was adjusted over tow speeds of about 0.9-1.1 m/second to maintain a wire angle at 45?. At this angle, the effective mouth area of the Tucker trawl is 1.0 m2 ; tow depths were estimated as a function of wire angle and meters of wire out. Four discrete depth strata (0-25, 25-50, 50-100, and 100-200 m) were sampled. Replicate tows at each depth comprised a sampling series. To sample at discrete depths without contamination by animals from shallower depths, the trawl was lowered with the first net open, and the second net was opened for the desired sampling time and then closed, and the trawl was retrieved with the third net open. To sample the two shallower strata, the trawl was lowered to 50 m, the second net was opened at that depth, and then the third net was opened at 25 m to sample the shallow stratum. For the two deeper strata, the second net was closed at the upper end of each stratum, and the trawl was retrieved with the third net open. Thus, a full set of duplicate samples for each depth stratum required six deployments of the trawl. The summer cruise had two series of night sampling (9-10 and 28-29 July) and one of day sampling (14-15 July); the winter cruise had one series of day and night sampling (4-10 February 1985). Each net was fished for 18 minutes and tows were conducted in a stepped oblique fashion, in an attempt to sample depths equally within each stratum. The volume of water filtered was estimated with calibrated General Oceanics flowmeters mounted in the center of each net. Plankton samples were preserved at sea in a 4% buffered formaldehyde seawater mixture. In the laboratory, plankton volume was determined from a known total volume minus the remaining water volume after the plankton were strained (Omori and Ikeda 1984); gelatinous plankton and fishes larger than approximately 50 mm were removed before the volume was determined. Whole samples were sorted for fish eggs, larvae, and squid para larvae under a dissecting microscope. Larval fishes were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level by Bruce Mundy.Describes investigative techniques focused on genetic characteristics of individuals and populations, and explains how this information helps improve existing natural populations and potentially impede invasive populations.GEOTRACES, An International Study of Marine Biogeochemical Cycles of Trace Elements and their IsotopesiDigBio (en)Surface ocean velocities estimated from HF-Radar are representitive of the upper 0.3 - 2.5 meters of the ocean.

In addition to numerous discoveries (e.g. fluorescent sharks, new large deep-sea squid, UV vision in deep-sea crabs, the importance of polarized light and bioluminescent searchlights), these expeditions developed several new technologies. The Eye-in-the-Sea is now a robust stealth camera system; waveband, fluorescence, polarization, and UV imaging techniques are well-developed; and we can now collect deep-sea benthic species without damaging their eyes. Together these achievements place us in a unique position to explore the deep sea in innovative and exciting ways. In 2007 we propose to extend the envelope of this exciting frontier in ocean exploration in two ways: 1) developing further imaging and listening technologies, 2) using the currently developed methods to explore the cliffs in the Bahamas that range from the surface to 3000 feet in depth. Results from this proposal will characterize an important deep-sea benthic environment, and use new technologies to locate inorganic and organic ocean resources, fulfilling two of the main themes of Ocean Exploration. The proposed cliff sites range from shallow coral reefs to the abyssal plain and will allow us to explore a large number of benthic communities in a small location and learn how depth affects undersea life. Given the technological focus of our research however, if the ships' schedules should make it difficult to work in this area we would welcome the opportunity to test these new technologies at any biologically rich sites. Unlike many research cruises, which focus in depth on one problem and method, we propose a number of smaller projects that are linked by the methods and questions of visual ecology and optical oceanography. The ultimate goal of our highly interdisciplinary group of researchers is to explore and characterize the deep-sea world in these new ways.In advance of design, permitting, and construction of a pipeline to deliver North Slope natural gas to out-of-state customers and Alaska communities, the Division of Geological & Geophysical Surveys (DGGS) has acquired lidar (light detection and ranging) data along proposed pipeline routes, nearby areas of infrastructure, and regions where significant geologic hazards have been identified.

The NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service Mississippi Laboratories at Pascagoula and Stennis Space Center and the NOAA National Coastal Data Development Center (NCDDC) at Stennis Space Center began the Hypoxia Watch project in 2001. Scientists aboard the NOAA Research Vessel Oregon II measure seawater properties, such as water temperature, salinity, chlorophyll, and dissolved oxygen at each of approximately 240 locations as the Oregon II cruises the waters south of Pascagoula, MS and then makes its way from Brownsville, Texas, to the mouth of the Mississippi River. A scientist aboard the ship processes the measurements from electronic dissolved oxygen sensors, checks the measurements periodically with chemical analyses of the seawater, then sends the data by e-mail to NCDDC at Stennis Space Center approximately every three to five days. Physical Scientists at NCDDC transform the dissolved oxygen measurements into contour maps, which identify areas of low oxygen, or hypoxia. During the 6-week cruise, as the data is received from the ship, NCDDC generates new maps and immediately publishes them on the web. The first map will usually cover an area off the Mississippi coast, successive maps will add areas of the continental shelf from Brownsville to Galveston, and the final map will usually cover the entire Texas-Louisiana-Mississippi coast. Maps are published every three to five days from approximately June 10 to July 20.SCAR initiates, develops and coordinates scientific research in the Antarctic region and provides objective independent scientific advice to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings.Informatics Europe is the association of computer science departments and research laboratories in Europe and neighboring areas.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

This was a multi-year project which follows earlier studies of long-term bottom trawling impacts in the same general region. The study area was within the Crab and Halibut Protection Zone 1 in Bristol Bay (management area 512; approximately latitude 58 degrees north and longitude 160 degrees west. In general, at-sea work was divided into three phases: (1) integrated biological and geological sampling before experimental trawling, (2) experimental trawling and (3) integrated biological and geological sampling after experimental trawling. Survey activities were conducted aboard the 47.2 meter (155 ft) chartered vessel Ocean Explorer. This was a commercial fishing vessel modified to support the research activities. Activity during phase 1 consisted of side scan assessments of seafloor morphology with an interferometric Klein 5410 side scan sonar towfish during night wheel watches, and epifauna trawls and collection of infauna and sediment grabs during daylight hours. All samples from a particular gear were collected in succession, so as to minimize time spent installing and configuring gear during phases (1) and (3). Assessment activities after the impact phase were a repeat of activities prior to experimental trawling.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

Rugosity is defined as the ratio of surface area to planar area and is used as a measure of benthic terrain complexity or "roughness". Rugosity values near 1 represent flat, smooth terrain, while higher values reflect increasing rugosity or terrain roughness. For rugosity grid interpretation, is is recommended that the grid be reclassified according to standard deviation divisions.NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Team, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory, federal, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data in the US Virgin Islands from 2/1/05 to 2/12/05. Data was acquired with a pole-mounted Reson 8101 ER multibeam echosounder (240 kHz) and processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS v5.4 software. Data has all correctors applied (attitude, sound velocity) and has been reduced to mean lower low water (MLLW) using final approved tides and zoning from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM zone 20 north, datum NAD83. The processed CARIS data was used to generate a CARIS BASE surface based on swath angle. An ASCII XYZ file was exported from the BASE surface and opened in ESRI ArcMap 9 as an XY event. Then the ArcToolbox conversion tool 'Feature to Raster' was used to generate an ESRI Grid of bathymetry. The Benthic Terrain Modeller (BTM) tool, a collection of ArcGIS terrain visualization tools developed by the Oregon State University (OSU) Department of Geosciences and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Coastal Services Center, was used to calculate the rugosity of that bathymetric grid. More information on the specific algorithms used can be found in the BTM's documentation.The project was conducted to meet IHO Order 1 and 2 accuracy standards, dependant on the project area and depth.

NEXRAD is a network of 160 high-resolution Doppler weather radars operated by the NOAA National Weather Service (NWS), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and the U.S. Air Force (USAF). Doppler radars detect atmospheric precipitation and winds, which allow scientists to track and anticipate weather events, such as rain, ice pellets, snow, hail, and tornadoes, as well as some non-weather objects like birds and insects. NEXRAD stations use the Weather Surveillance Radar - 1988, Doppler (WSR-88D) system. This is a 10 cm wavelength (S-Band) radar that operates at a frequency between 2,700 and 3,000 MHz. The radar system operates in two basic modes: a slow-scanning Clear Air Mode (Mode B) for analyzing air movements when there is little or no precipitation activity in the area, and a Precipitation Mode (Mode A) with a faster scan for tracking active weather. The two modes employ nine Volume Coverage Patterns (VCPs) to adequately sample the atmosphere based on weather conditions. A VCP is a series of 360 degree sweeps of the antenna at pre-determined elevation angles and pulse repetition frequencies completed in a specified period of time. The radar scan times 4.5, 5, 6 or 10 minutes depending on the selected VCP. During 2008, the WSR-88D radars were upgraded to produce increased spatial resolution data, called Super Resolution. The earlier Legacy Resolution data provides radar reflectivity at 1.0 degree azimuthal by 1 km range gate resolution to a range of 460 km, and Doppler velocity and spectrum width at 1.0 degree azimuthal by 250 m range gate resolution to a range of 230 km. The upgraded Super Resolution data provides radar reflectivity at 0.5 degree azimuthal by 250 m range gate resolution to a range of 460 km, and Doppler velocity and spectrum width at 0.5 degree azimuthal by 250 m range gate resolution to a range of 300 km. Super resolution makes a compromise of slightly decreased noise reduction for a large gain in resolution. In 2010, the deployment of the Dual Polarization (Dual Pol) capability to NEXRAD sites began with the first operational Dual Pol radar in May 2011. Dual Pol radar capability adds vertical polarization to the previous horizontal radar waves, in order to more accurately discern the return signal. This allows the radar to better distinguish between types of precipitation (e.g., rain, hail and snow), improves rainfall estimates, improves data retrieval in mountainous terrain, and aids in removal of non-weather artifacts. The NEXRAD products are divided in two data processing levels. The lower Level II data are the three meteorological base data quantities at original resolution: reflectivity, mean radial velocity, and spectrum width. Level II data are recorded at all NWS and most USAF and FAA WSR-88D sites. From the Level II quantities, computer processing generates numerous meteorological analysis Level III products. NEXRAD data are provided to the NOAA National Climatic Data Center for archiving and dissemination to users. Data coverage varies by station and ranges from June 1991 to 1 day from present. Most stations began observing in the mid-1990s, and most period of records are continuous.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

Data were compiled under the direction of J.M. Monget of Ecoles de Mines, Paris through 1976 and contain data for nearly 200 core, dredge, and grab samples. Data include method of analysis, oxide/item/element concentrations, location, water depth, sample lithology, and bibliographic references. The CNEXO data are also available as part of the NGDC marine minerals database and are offered on the NOAA & MMS Marine Minerals CD-ROM data set released by NGDC in October of 1992. The CNEXO data are also available for direct download from NGDC's web server.Two spatially and temporally discordant research cruises were conducted to account for seasonal movements and potential differences in sampling efficiency at these different depths: a fall 2006 cruise conducted within inshore areas west of Tampa Bay and a summer 2007 cruise conducted in the Florida Middle Grounds. Stationary underwater video camera arrays, chevron traps, longlines and kali poles were deployed in 2006, and hook-and-line surveys were added in 2007. Results from these two cruises were used to compare and calibrate catch rates from multiple sampling methods to identify the most effective gear types in targeting reef fish assemblages, and to investigate the importance of habitat on catch rates of reef fishes. During the fall 2006 research cruise, a total of 110 stationary video camera array deployments, 113 chevron trap deployments, 171 kali pole deployments, and 92 longline deployments were done. A total of 3,158 individuals from 42 taxa were identified on the video reads; catches were dominated numerically by Decapterus spp., Caranx crysos, Diplectrum formosum, and Haemulon aurolineatum. Chevron traps caught a total of 459 fish/macro-invertebrates from 20 taxa, with Rhomboplites aurorubens, Diplectrum formosum, Calamus proridens, and Haemulon aurolineatum being the most abundant. A total of 359 fishes from 26 different fish taxa were collected in longline sets; catch was dominated by Epinephelus morio, which comprised 40.1% of the total catch. A total of 62 fish from 14 different taxa were collected in kali pole sets, with Epinephelus morio comprising 29% of the total catch. During the summer 2007 research cruise, a total of 51 stationary video camera array deployments, 164 chevron trap deployments, 332 kali pole deployments, 84 longline deployments, and 51 hook-and-line surveys were completed. A total of 1,635 individuals were identified from 67 taxa in the 51 video deployments observed; catches were dominated by Decapterus spp., Stegastes spp., and mixed pomacentrids, which represented almost 62% of the total individuals observed. Many commercially and recreationally important taxa were also observed. A total of 630 individuals were caught in chevron traps, including 24 fishes and two crab species; catches were dominated numerically by Rhomboplites aurorubens. Twenty-three different fish taxa were collected in longline sets, with Epinephelus morio comprising 62.7% of the total catch. A total of 161 fish from 15 different taxa were collected in kali pole sets, with Epinephelus morio comprising 71.4% of the total catch. During hook-and-line surveys, a total of 317 individuals were obtained, from 24 distinct taxa. Catch was dominated by Epinephelus morio, which comprised 43.2% of the total catch and occurred at 72.6% of all survey locations. Based on these comparisons, it appears that a combination of stationary video camera arrays, chevron traps, and at least one hooked gear would likely be the most efficient and cost-effective approach to monitoring reef fish resources along the west Florida shelf.Description of technique and equipment for high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) used to identify organic compounds in chemical analysis.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Branch, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster, as well as federal, university, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data off the South Atlantic Bight from 11/13/2010 to 11/22/2010. Data was acquired with a hull-mounted Kongsberg Simrad EM 122 multibeam echosounder (100 kHz). It was processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS software. Attitude and sound velocity correctors applied to the data. Verified tides were not applied to the data, leaving the depth values referenced to the ellipsoid. The imagery is projected in the UTM Zone 17 north, NAD83 datum. The backscatter component of the bathymetry data were geometrically and radiometrically corrected using Geocoder 3.x software. Acoustic backscatter mosaics are ostensibly an important piece of information when characterizing surficial seafloor features and delineating benthic habitats.Leeds University LibraryThis project is a cooperative effort between the National Ocean Service, Office of National Marine Sanctuaries, the National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science, Center for Coastal Monitoring and Assessment, the state of Florida, Analytical Laboratories of Hawaii, LLC., the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, and NOVA Southeastern University, National Coral Reef Institute. The goal of the effort is to use NOAA-developed mapping methods to produce shallow-water (<30 m) benthic habitat maps of southern Florida. The maps are generated by visual interpretation of georeferenced IKONOS and WorldView-2 satellite imagery. The underwater video clips and still images are collected to either perform ground validation (GV) of seafloor habitat features during visual interpretation of high-resolution satellite imagery and map preparation or independently assess the accuracy (AA) of the habitat map.This dataset contains an ESRI Grid representing the rugosity of the bathymetry of Buck Island channel, along the north shore of St. Croix, US Virgin Islands, based on a 10m bathymetric grid. Rugosity is defined as the ratio of surface area to planar area and is used as a measure of benthic terrain complexity or "roughness". Rugosity values near 1 represent flat, smooth terrain, while higher values reflect increasing rugosity or terrain roughness. For rugosity grid interpretation, is is recommended that the grid be reclassified according to standard deviation divisions.NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Team, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory, federal, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data in the US Virgin Islands from 2/1/05 to 2/12/05. Data was acquired with a pole-mounted Reson 8101 ER multibeam echosounder (240 kHz) and processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS v5.4 software. Data has all correctors applied (attitude, sound velocity) and has been reduced to mean lower low water (MLLW) using final approved tides and zoning from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM zone 20 north, datum NAD83. The processed CARIS data was used to generate a CARIS BASE surface based on swath angle. An ASCII XYZ file was exported from the BASE surface and opened in ESRI ArcMap 9 as an XY event. Then the ArcToolbox conversion tool 'Feature to Raster' was used to generate an ESRI Grid of bathymetry. The Benthic Terrain Modeller (BTM) tool, a collection of ArcGIS terrain visualization tools developed by the Oregon State University (OSU) Department of Geosciences and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Coastal Services Center, was used to calculate the rugosity of that bathymetric grid. More information on the specific algorithms used can be found in the BTM's documentation.The project was conducted to meet IHO Order 1 and 2 accuracy standards, dependant on the project area and depth.

The enhanced (E-50) product suite was launched on September 30, 2009. Its counterpart, the operational product suite, was implemented initially in 2000. Both product suites provide updated monitoring information twice-weekly. This metadata file provides information on the E-50 DHW product for both the most recent near-real-time updates and the archived E-50 DHW product, dating back to October 2007, when the E-50 DHW product first became available. A DHW measures accumulation of bleaching thermal stress that coral reefs experience over a period of 12 consecutive weeks (about 3 months), ending on the day indicated in the product. It is derived from the Coral Bleaching HotSpots product (another key tool in the CRW operational product suite). A Coral Bleaching HotSpot is a specific type of sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly that measures the amount of SST exceeding a static coral bleaching threshold SST; it serves as a measure of instantaneous bleaching thermal stress and shows the occurrence, magnitude, and spatial distribution of the stress. All non-positive HotSpot values are recorded as zeros. The DHW value (again, a measurement of accumulated thermal stress) is, in its most simplistic form, the sum of all of the individual twice-weekly HotSpot values at any particular location, within a 12-week period and with a magnitude of at least 1 degree Celsius, multiplied by the duration of the twice-weekly HotSpot value (i.e., 0.5 weeks). A more complicated formula describing how the DHW value is calculated can be obtained at http://coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/satellite/methodology/methodology.php#dhw. One DHW is equivalent to one week of SST at 1 degree Celsius above the threshold, or 0.5 weeks of SST at two degrees Celsius above the threshold. The E-50 DHW product is derived from CRW's E-50 HotSpots product, which is calculated from CRW's E-50 SST based on near-real-time satellite data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) on some of NOAA's Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites (POES), as with the operational SST. CRW's entire experimental E-50 satellite coral bleaching thermal stress monitoring product suite is based on the enhanced 50-km SST product. The E-50 DHW provides two major improvements over the current operational 50-km DHW product: full coastal coverage and improved climatology. The E-50 SST product that the E-50 DHW product is based on produces SST data for areas closer to the coast globally. This is achieved through the use of a higher-resolution land mask and retrieval of satellite data in coastal regions excluded from analysis by the operational land mask. Availability of satellite data for coastal areas greatly improves monitoring of coral reef ecosystems, the majority of which occur along coasts. While the current operational SST product enables direct monitoring of only 40% of the world's coral reefs, the E-50 SST product uses the new 50-km land mask to provide SST monitoring for more than 99% of 50-km pixels that contain coral reefs globally. The operational 50-km HotSpots product that the operational DHW product is derived from is sensitive to errors in the climatology (long-term average conditions) used in the analysis. The E-50 climatology, used to develop the E-50 product suite, improves the overall accuracy of CRW products. It uses the 1985-2006 Version 5.0 Pathfinder 4-km AVHRR SSTs to address known climatology errors in CRW's operational 50-km product suite. Errors include overestimation of the operational 50-km HotSpots and DHW in certain areas, such as the Gulf of Panama and Gulf of Oman regions. Related details, as well as other important information, are provided on the E-50 portion of the CRW web site: http://coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/satellite/e50/index.php. The E-50 DHW product is available in static image and Google Earth formats. The product, its detailed description, and available data formats and delivery mechanisms are accessible at http://coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/satellite, along with general CRW product information and access to other CRW products.Locations of USGS science centers focused on climate change, with a brief description of the scientific focus and regional partner organizations.This British Geological Survey (BGS) survey took place in July/August 1995) in the Wash on board the Greyhound Tracker.

This partnership program between NOAA and the coastal states protects more than one million acres of estuarine land and water, which provides essential habitat for wildlife; offers educational opportunities for students, teachers and the public; and serves as living laboratories for scientists. NOAA provides funding, national guidance, and technical assistance. Each reserve is managed on a daily basis by a lead state agency or university, with input from local partners. NERR System Wide Monitoring Project (SWMP) The National Estuarine Research Reserve System-wide Monitoring Program tracks short-term variability and long-term changes in estuarine waters to understand how human activities and natural events can change ecosystems. It provides valuable long-term data on water quality, water nutrient levels, and weather at frequent time intervals. Coastal managers use this monitoring data to make informed decisions on local and regional issues, such as no-discharge zones for boats and measuring the success of restoration projects. The reserve system currently measures physical and chemical water quality indicators, nutrients and the impacts of weather on estuaries. As the program expands, plans include adding a biological monitoring component and tracking changes in land use through remote sensing. North Inlet  Winyah Bay Reserves Weather Monitoring Program The North Inlet Estuary and the adjacent lower northeastern section of Winyah Bay Estuary were designated as part of the National Estuarine Research Reserve System in 1992. The North Inlet - Winyah Bay (NIW) Reserve is managed/hosted by the University of South Carolina, Belle W. Baruch Institute for Marine and Coastal Sciences, at the Baruch Marine Field Laboratory. Its environmental monitoring program began running under the auspices of the NERR program in June 1993. In 1995, the NERR program began a System-Wide Monitoring Program that set protocols for monitoring the estuarine environment, starting with water quality. Collection protocols for weather data were being developed and implemented in 1997, at which time the NIW reserves data collection procedures changed to follow these new guidelines. Official SWMP weather protocols were implemented in 2001. Weather data collected under the NERR program are a continuation of the Baruch Institutes long-term meteorological data set, which began in 1982, with rainfall data extending back into 1978. The NIW NERR weather station is located at the end of the Oyster Landing pier. The station includes sensors for air temperature, relative humidity, photosynthetically active solar radiation (PAR, collected by a LiCor Quantum sensor), barometric pressure, wind speed, wind direction, solar radiation (Eppley black and white pyranometer, wavelengths between 280 and 2800 nm), and precipitation. All sensors are located on an aluminum tower at a height of approximately 3.5 meters (with the exception of the rain gauge, which is adjacent to the boardwalk) and are wired into a Campbell Scientific CR10X data logger. The data logger program, provided by the NERR Centralized Data Management Office (CDMO), determines and implements the data collection schedule. Readings are taken every 5 seconds continuously throughout the year and various average, instantaneous, and total data are reported for 15-minute, hourly, and 24-hour time intervals. Over the course of this database, there were protocol changes in data collection and reporting. See the Supplemental Information section (below) for some general information, the Completeness Report and the NERRMET.MissingAnomalous.2000-2004 document for more detailed information, and the Field Methodology Description for a complete data collection schedule.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

DOI/GTN-P consists of two subnetworks: 1) a network of 15 automated surface stations, and 2) a 20-element deep borehole array. The surface stations continuously monitor changes in permafrost active-layer as well as a number of other climate parameters, including: permafrost tempe rature, soil moisture, snow depth, air temperature, wind speed and direction, up- and downwelling shortwave radiation, albedo, and cloudiness. A portion of the surface network is now available in near real-time through radio telemetry. Vegetation changes are co incidentally monitored at these sites. The borehole array is used to monitor the thermal state of the underlying permafrost. This is the largest array of deep boreholes in the world currently available for monitoring the thermal state of permafrost. Many of the surface stations are co-located with deep boreholes, effectively forming 'permafrost observatories.' In conjunction with DOI/GTN-P, we are developing models for synthesizing climate observations and for investigating how the cryosphere responds to climate chan ge. These models will improve existing predictive capabilities for DOI lands. Climate projections by global coupled Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models (AOGCMs) suggest significant environmental changes will occur in the Arctic during the next 80 years (http://www.acia.uaf.edu). According to these models, climate change will be Arctic-wide with a pronounced enhancement over the Arctic Ocean and adjacent coastal plains. These projections suggest large climate-induced landscape and ecosystem changes are likely to occur in northern Alaska during the next few decades. Important issues for DOI lands in this region include: permafrost degradation; vulnerability of high northern infrastructure to permafrost instability; large potential greenhouse gas (CO2, methane) emissi ons form warming permafrost; shifting vegetation patterns; impacts of habitat changes of wildlife; changing stream flow and lake levels; impacts of ecosystem changes on Native peoples: and, coastal erosion, inundation of coastal areas by storm surges. Given the large potential impacts, and the significant uncertainty in the model projections, a comprehensive monitoring effort is warranted.Arsenic is a naturally occurring element in rocks, soils, and the waters in contact with them.

Rugosity is defined as the ratio of surface area to planar area and is used as a measure of benthic terrain complexity or "roughness". Rugosity values near 1 represent flat, smooth terrain, while higher values reflect increasing rugosity or terrain roughness. For rugosity grid interpretation, is is recommended that the grid be reclassified according to standard deviation divisions.NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Team and NOAA/NOS/OCS/HSD personnel, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory, federal, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data in the US Virgin Islands from 2/18/04 to 3/5/04. Data was acquired with a pole-mounted Reson 8101 ER multibeam echosounder (240 kHz) and processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS v5.4 software. Data has all correctors applied (attitude, sound velocity) and has been reduced to mean lower low water (MLLW) using final approved tides from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM zone 20 north, datum WGS84. The processed CARIS data was used to generate a CARIS BASE surface based on swath angle with footprint size 3*3. An ASCII XYZ file was exported from the BASE surface and opened in ESRI ArcMap 9 as an XY event. Then the ArcToolbox conversion tool 'Feature to Raster' was used to generate an ESRI Grid of bathymetry. The Benthic Terrain Modeller (BTM) tool, a collection of ArcGIS terrain visualization tools developed by the Oregon State University (OSU) Department of Geosciences and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Coastal Services Center, was used to calculate the rugosity of that bathymetric grid. More information on the specific algorithms used can be found in the BTM's documentation.While the project was conducted to meet IHO Order 2 accuracy standards, there is a roll artifact (averaging 0.5m high) in the dataset that the user should take into consideration when performing any analysis.datatracker.ietf.org RFC and Internet-Draft Search Use datatracker.ietf.org to search for Internet-Drafts and RFCsThese data inform the public of the most recent stock status for all stocks (FSSI and non-FSSI) in the fishery management unit contained in a fishery managment plan. Stock status includes overfishing, overfished, and approaching overfished condition; for FSSI stocks B/Bmsy estimates and FSSI scor are also included. Files are in PDF format and are posted quarterly on the Office of Sustainable Fisheries website. The FSSI is a performance measure for the sustainability of 230 US fish stocks selected for their importance to commercial and recreational fisheries, and their ability to be assessed. The FSSI will increase as stock status becomes known, overfishing has ended, and stocks increase to a level that provides maximum sustainable yield. B/Bmsy is a measure of current stock biomass relative to the target biomass level (the biomass that produces maximum sustainable yield, or MSY). FSSI scores are updated quarterly and are available from 2005 to present.

These data serve as a foundation for biodiversity and conservation research.N/ANOAA's National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) is building high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) for select U.S. coastal regions. These integrated bathymetric-topographic DEMs are used to support tsunami forecasting and modeling efforts at the NOAA Center for Tsunami Research, Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL). The DEMs are part of the tsunami forecast system SIFT (Short-term Inundation Forecasting for Tsunamis) currently being developed by PMEL for the NOAA Tsunami Warning Centers, and are used in the MOST (Method of Splitting Tsunami) model developed by PMEL to simulate tsunami generation, propagation, and inundation. Bathymetric, topographic, and shoreline data used in DEM compilation are obtained from various sources, including NGDC, the U.S. National Ocean Service (NOS), the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and other federal, state, and local government agencies, academic institutions, and private companies. DEMs are referenced to the vertical tidal datum of Mean High Water (MHW) and horizontal datum of World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84). Cell size ranges from 1/3 arc-second (~10 meters) to 36 arc-seconds (~1 km). DEMs built by PMEL's NOAA Center for Tsunami Research (formerly NOAA Center for Tsunami Inundation Mapping Efforts) are available for download from the web site.The Protected Areas Database of the United States (PAD-US) is a geodatabase, managed by U. S. Geological Survey Gap Analysis Program, that illustrates and describes public land ownership, management and other conservation lands, including voluntarily provided privately protected areas. The geodatabase contains four feature classes such as, Marine Protected Areas (MPA) and Easements that each contains uniquely associated attributes. These two feature classes are combined with the PAD-US Fee feature class to provide a full inventory of protected areas in a common schema (i.e. Combined file). Legitimate and other protected area overlaps exist in the full inventory, with Easements loaded on top of Fee and MPAs under both. Parcel data within a protected area are dissolved in this file that powers the PAD-US Viewer. As overlaps exist, GAP creates separate analytical layers to summarize area statistics for "GAP Status Code" and "Owner Name". Contact the PAD-US Coordinator for more information. The lands included in PAD-US are assigned conservation measures that qualify their intent to manage lands for the preservation of biological diversity and to other natural, recreational and cultural uses; managed for these purposes through legal or other effective means. The geodatabase includes: 1) Geographic boundaries of public land ownership and voluntarily provided private conservation lands (e.g., Nature Conservancy Preserves); 2) The combination land owner, land manager, management designation or type, parcel name, GIS Acres and source of geographic information of each mapped land unit 3) GAP Status Code conservation measure of each parcel based on USGS National Gap Analysis Program (GAP) protection level categories which provide a measurement of management intent for long-term biodiversity conservation 4) IUCN category for a protected area's inclusion into UNEP-World Conservation Monitoring Centre's World Database for Protected Areas. IUCN protected areas are defined as, "A clearly defined geographical space, recognized, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values" and are categorized following a classification scheme available through USGS GAP; 5) World Database of Protected Areas (WDPA) Site Codes linking the multiple parcels of a single protected area in PAD-US and connecting them to the Global Community. The geodatabase contains a Marine Protected Area (MPA) feature class and Easements feature class, each with uniquely associated attribute. These two feature classes are combined with the PAD-US fee feature class with standard PAD-US attributes to provide a full inventory of protected areas in a common schema. As legitimate and other overlaps exist in the combined inventory GAP creates separate analytical layers to obtain area statistics for "GAP Status Code" and "Owner Name". PAD-US version 1.3 Combined updates include: 1) State, local government and private protected area updates delivered September 2011 from PAD-US State Data Stewards: CO (Colorado State University), FL (Florida Natural Areas Inventory), ID (Idaho Fish and Game), MA (The Commonwealth's Office of Geographic Information Systems, MassGIS), MO (University of Missouri, MoRAP), MT (Montana Natural Heritage Program), NM (Natural Heritage New Mexico), OR (Oregon Natural Heritage Program), VA (Department of Conservation and Recreation, Virginia Natural Heritage Program). 2) Select local government (i.e. county, city) protected areas (3,632) across the country (to complement the current PAD-US inventory) aggregated by the Trust for Public Land (TPL) for their Conservation Almanac that tracks the conservation finance movement across the country. 3) A new Date of Establishment field that identifies the year an area was designated or otherwise protected, attributed for 86% of GAP Status Code 1 and 2 protected areas.

Classification values are:Class 1: UnclassifiedClass 2: GroundUnderwater archaeologists, led by James Adovasio and Andy Hemmings of Mercyhurst College, dove at four sites that were first visited in 2009. At these locations, electronically documented intact river channel features of the Pleistocene Suwannee River are now filled with multiple layers of sediment. These sites are covered by 40 to 130 feet of ocean water and are located 50 to 125 miles offshore of the modern Gulf Coast of Florida northwest of Tampa or southeast of Tallahassee. The three shallower sites have bedrock exposed on the seafloor that forms one side of the buried channel. The bedrock at each of these sites is low grade knappable toolstone that could have been used for tool making. The deepest site, Thor?s Elbow, is the intersection of the ancient Suwannee and another river where they expected to find more knappable bedrock buried under the modern surface. At each of these sites divers hoped to locate prehistoric human made artifacts, bones of Pleistocene animals, such as the mastodon, and perhaps datable organic material such as pieces of wood. Any such finds would indicate that the now inundated Pleistocene landscape of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico is still preserved, accessible to archaeologists, and contains prehistoric evidence of the use of this landscape by people and animals alive at the end of the last Ice Age.WMSCaseRe3 CaseRe3 DSpace repositoryThis image represents a 0.5 meter resolution backscatter mosaic of the north shore of Buck Island, St. Croix, US Virgin Islands. NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Team and NOAA/NOS/OCS/HSD personnel, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory, federal, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data in the US Virgin Islands from 2/18/04 to 3/5/04. Data was acquired with a pole-mounted Reson 8101 ER multibeam echosounder (240 kHz) and processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS v5.4 software. Data has all correctors applied (attitude, sound velocity) and has been reduced to mean lower low water (MLLW) using final approved tides from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM zone 20 north, datum WGS84. Within CARIS, each line of backscatter data was evaluated for bottom tracking and was slant-range corrected. Data was not corrected for gain or transmit power artifacts. Backscatter mosaics were then created using the CARIS shine-through option. Finally, a georeferenced imagery file was exported from the mosaic. While the project was conducted to meet IHO Order 2 accuracy standards, there is a roll artifact (averaging 0.5m high) in the dataset that the user should take into consideration when performing any analysis.This dataset contains an ESRI Grid representing the rugosity of the bathymetry of the Mid Shelf Reef south of St. Thomas, US Virgin Islands, based on a 5m bathymetric grid. Rugosity is defined as the ratio of surface area to planar area and is used as a measure of benthic terrain complexity or "roughness". Rugosity values near 1 represent flat, smooth terrain, while higher values reflect increasing rugosity or terrain roughness. For rugosity grid interpretation, is is recommended that the grid be reclassified according to standard deviation divisions.NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Team, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory, federal, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data in the US Virgin Islands from 2/1/05 to 2/12/05. Data was acquired with a pole-mounted Reson 8101 ER multibeam echosounder (240 kHz) and processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS v5.4 software. Data has all correctors applied (attitude, sound velocity) and has been reduced to mean lower low water (MLLW) using final approved tides and zoning from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM zone 20 north, datum NAD83. The processed CARIS data was used to generate a CARIS BASE surface based on swath angle. An ASCII XYZ file was exported from the BASE surface and opened in ESRI ArcMap 9 as an XY event. Then the ArcToolbox conversion tool 'Feature to Raster' was used to generate an ESRI Grid of bathymetry. The Benthic Terrain Modeller (BTM) tool, a collection of ArcGIS terrain visualization tools developed by the Oregon State University (OSU) Department of Geosciences and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Coastal Services Center, was used to calculate the rugosity of that bathymetric grid. More information on the specific algorithms used can be found in the BTM's documentation.The project was conducted to meet IHO Order 1 and 2 accuracy standards, dependant on the project area and depth. All users should individually evaluate the suitability of this data according to their own needs and standards.These images are part of a project funded by NOAA Coastal Services Center to develop a high quality, user-friendly, attributed, centralized, multi-territorial digital database of georeferenced historic aerial imagery in the Pacific Islands region, including Hawaii, American Samoa, Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. The objective of this project is to make previously unavailable historic aerial imagery of the Pacific Islands available for public consumption through NOAA's Digital Coast website. These images were scanned on a flatbed scanner and georeferenced to existing basemap data.The TIGER/Line shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. The Area Hydrography Shapefile contains the geometry and attributes of both perennial and intermittent area hydrography features, including ponds, lakes, oceans, swamps (up to the U.S. nautical three-mile limit), glaciers, and the area covered by large rivers, streams, and/or canals that are represented as double-line drainage. Single-line drainage water features can be found in the Linear Hydrography Shapefile (LINEARWATER.shp). Linear water features includes single-line drainage water features and artificial path features, where they exist, that run through double-line drainage features such as rivers, streams, and/or canals, and serve as a linear representation of these features.UAF Geospatial metadata search.The US Voluntary Observing Ships (VOS) report surface marine observations in both real-time (FM-13 ship format) and delayed-mode (International Maritime Meteorological Tape - IMMT format). To do this, most operating vessels use e-logbook software that allows an observer to enter information, then the software can transmit a real-time report as well as save the same report in a different format to the ship's hard drive for later access, i.e. delayed mode observation (DM). Once in port, all DM reports stored on the hard drive are retrieved and sent to the National Climatic Data Center for archiving and processing. The e-logbook software used in this dataset is the TurboWin+ program and structures data in the IMMT-5 format.WMSThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

This geologic map shows the distribution and stratigraphic relation of volcanic, intrusive, and sedimentary units emplaced in the past 8 million years across the eight principal islands of the Hawaiian archipelago, State of Hawaii, U.S.A. This geologic map is available in several formats including: ESRI Service, WMS, geosciml-portrayal WFS, geodatabase (native mapinfo files), shapefiles, geodatabase (e00 export files), or as downloadable plates (pdfs) from the USGS landing page (see "USGS Publications - Geologic Map of Hawaii and related links" link on the left side of the page). On the USGS landing page, the State's geology is presented on eight full-color map sheets, one for each of the major islands. These map sheets can be downloaded in pdf format, ready to print. Map scale is 1:100,000 for most of the islands, so that each map is about 27 inches by 36 inches. The Island of Hawaii, largest of the islands, is depicted at a smaller scale, 1:250,000, so that it, too, can be shown on 36-inch-wide paper. Both the WMS and WFS services and the USGS maps are based on the same dataset published by Sherrod, et al 2007, and are distributed by the USGS and University of Hawaii. Services are being provided by the Arizona Geological Survey.powered by the HUBzero(R) Platform for Scientific CollaborationThe NOAA/NOS and USCGS Seabed Descriptions from Hydrographic Surveys database is a compilation of surficial sediment composition from multiple sources for over 200,000 seafloor sediment samples primarily around U.S. coastal areas. The descriptions were abstracted from unpublished data reports and Bottom Type "M" log sheets, and digitized from survey smooth sheets produced by the NOAA National Ocean Service (NOS) and its predecessor, the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey (USCGS). Prior to August 2001, many physical sediment samples were routinely sent to the Smithsonian Institution Museum of Natural History (NMNH) for archive with accompanying "M" log forms from which bottom type and other information were coded into the NMNH sediment database. In 2001, NMNH sent a copy of the database to NGDC to be incorporated into the Index to Marine and Lacustrine Geological Samples database, and for distribution to data users needing access to the bottom type information in the files. With support from NOS, NGDC digitized several thousand additional bottom type observations from historic NOS Hydrographic Survey smooth sheets and added them to the database. NOS is coding thousands more bottom type observations for entry into the database from survey Data Reports, or DRs. In 2011, NOS began adding standardized digital bottom type descriptions to the database using the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) SF57 standard "NATSUR" (nature of surface) and "NATQUA" (nature of surface qualifier) coding scheme, transferring the data to NGDC in KML form for archive and upload to the geospatially-enabled database.

VCGI extracted the imagery from a larger dataset developed by 3001 Inc for the Federal government. The MISC_0_3M_CLR_2008 extract is limited to all collected imagery north and south of the VT/Canadian border. The imagery has been kept in its native coordinate system (UTM zone 18 and 19). For this dataset, the natural color orthoimages were produced at 0.3-meter pixel resolution (approximately 1-foot). The design accuracy is estimated not to exceed 6 meter horizontal RMSE for locations within the United States. Each orthoimage provides imagery for a 1500-meter by 1500-meter block on the ground. The projected coordinate system is UTM with a NAD83 datum, spheroid GRS80. There is no image overlap between adjacent files. The naming convention is based on the U.S. National Grid (USNG), taking the coordinates of the SW corner of the orthoimage.The USGS collects continuous stage, discharge, and other instantaneous time-series data on the nations rivers.

An estimated 43 coral species and 21 sponge species were collected and identified from 17 dives made by the DSV ALVIN on 5 seamounts. A large number of coral specimens were processed and packaged and sent the National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution upon disembarkation. Faunal assemblages on the corals included species from 12 different phyla and a large number (hundreds) of lesser taxa. Many of these species represent significant range extensions or records of undescribed species, but await post-cruise processing for identification and clarification. Plasma and tissue samples for genetic and physiological examination were collected from >120 crab specimens belonging to a number of species; tissue samples were collected from >130 shrimp for genetic studies. Samples of 62 coral specimens (22 bamboo, 15 paragorgid, 19 primnoid, 7 black, 23 other), 13 sponge specimens, and 36 water samples were collected for genomic studies of bacterial communities. 58 basaltic rocks were collected for geological studies and 4 rocks were collected for microbiological studies. Detailed mapping of the study area resulted in 14081 km2 of seamounts multibeamed, plus 9000 km2 of seafloor mapped while in transit, equaling 23081 km2 of total seafloor mapped. Education and outreach activities associated with the 2004 Gulf of Alaska Seamount Expedition were extensive, and included an NOAA Ocean Explorer Web site; lesson plans; a Professional Development Institutes (PDI) for Educators; 5 interactive satellite telephone calls to schools or institutes, which included conversations with scientists in situ aboard the Alvin; an Educator at Sea (Carey DeLauder, UCAP Science Teacher); nine undergradute and graduate students, a Dean John A. Knauss Sea Grant Fellow (Nicholas Alvarado), and a MATE Intern (Shinobu Okano) participated in the cruise; and, a media event at the termination of the cruise was held in Astoria, Oregon for public school teachers, newspaper, radio and television reporters. All aspects of the cruise were well documented, and all dives were designed to be multipurpose and collect data for all participants. The cruise was a resounding success and will produce a multitude of scientific discoveries.Marine Themes comprises authoritative data from the UK and other hydrographic offices, where available.

These data include CDOM fluorescence, conductivity, current speed - east/west component (U), current speed - north/south component (V), dissolved oxygen, hydrostatic pressure, salinity, sound velocity, temperature and water density. The instruments used to collect these data included ADCP, CTD, bathythermograph - XBT, fluorometer and oxygen meter along with other physical sampling devices. More specific information about each data set is located in their individual metadata records. The Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler ADCP used sonar to measure and record water current velocities and the distribution of suspended material over a range of depths. Absolute U- and V-component ocean current vectors from the ADCP collected can be used to create detailed maps of the distribution of water currents and suspended materials through the water column along the ship's path. The data from this ADCP is raw and unprocessed. Some of the datasets associated with this instrument are still incomplete and will be published as they become available. This data set also contains products created for use in real time analysis and decision support. These products may include charts, graphs, maps, plots, and GIS formatted data files. The CTD data underwent preliminary quality assurance and control procedures at the National Coastal Data Development Center (NCDDC). Cruise level information consisting of data management documents, cruise reports and plans, videos and pictures, and other miscellaneous documentation were gathered by the data managers.

Approximately 600, color, 9 by 9 inch photos were taken of the coastal waters of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands at 1:48000 scale. Specific sun angle and maximum percent cloud cover restrictions were adhered to when possible during photography missions to ensure collection of high quality imagery for the purpose of benthic mapping.Prints and diapositives were created from the original negatives. Diapositives were then scanned at a resolution of 500 dpi using a metric scanner, yielding 2.4 by 2.4 meter pixels for the 1:48000 scale photography. All scans were saved in TIF format for the purposes of orthorectification and photointerpretation. Original TIF's were also converted to *.jpg format to reduce file size and facilitate web-based image distribution.

After the apportionment of congressional seats among the States based on census population counts, each State is responsible for establishing congressional districts for the purpose of electing representatives. Each congressional district is to be as equal in population to all other congressional districts in a State as practicable. The 114th Congress is seated from January 2015 to 2017. The TIGER/Line shapefiles for the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas (American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) each contain a single record for the non-voting delegate district in these areas. The boundaries of all other congressional districts are provided to the Census Bureau through the Redistricting Data Program (RDP).Imagery, sampling information, and other data intended for use in assessing and remediating environmental problems related to the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010We assembled 1.4 million National Ocean Service (NOS) bathymetric soundings from 98 lead-line and single-beam echosounder hydrographic surveys conducted from 1910 to 1999 in Cook Inlet, Alaska. These bathymetry data are available from the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC: http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov), which archives and distributes data that were originally collected by the NOS and others. While various bathymetry data have been downloaded previously from NGDC, compiled, and used for a variety of projects, our effort differed in that we compared and corrected the digital bathymetry by studying the original analog source documents - digital versions of the original survey maps, called smooth sheets. Our editing included deleting erroneous and superseded values, digitizing missing values, and properly aligning all data sets to a common, modern datum. There were six areas where these older surveys were superseded by compilations of reduced-resolution multibeam surveys. We digitized 12,000 features, such as rocky reefs, kelp beds, rocks and islets, adding them to what was originally available, and creating the most thorough source (n = 18,000) of these typically shallow, inshore features. We also digitized 2,418 km of the mainland and 529 km of island shoreline, generally at a resolution of 1:20,000, and digitized 9,271 verbal surficial sediment descriptions from the smooth sheets. The depth surface, shoreline, inshore features, and sediment data sets are mostly produced at a scale of 1:20,000.This feature class represents sewer line nodes at Pipe Spring National Monument, Arizona.

Elevation measurements were collected over the area using the NASA Experimental Advanced Airborne Research Lidar (EAARL), a pulsed-laser ranging system mounted onboard an aircraft to measure ground elevation, vegetation canopy, and coastal topography. The system uses high frequency laser beams directed at the Earth's surface through an opening in the bottom of the aircraft's fuselage. The laser system records the time difference between emission of the laser beam and the reception of the reflected laser signal in the aircraft. The plane travels over the target area at approximately 50 meters per second at an elevation of approximately 300 meters. The EAARL, developed by NASA at Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia, measures ground elevation with a vertical resolution of 15 centimeters. A sampling rate of 3 kilohertz or higher results in an extremely dense spatial elevation dataset. Over 100 kilometers of coastline can be easily surveyed within a 3- to 4-hour mission. When subsequent elevation maps for an area are analyzed, they provide a useful tool to make management decisions regarding land development. For more information on Lidar science and the Experimental Advanced Airborne Research Lidar (EAARL) system and surveys, see http://ngom.usgs.gov/dsp/overview/index.php and http://ngom.usgs.gov/dsp/tech/eaarl/index.php .This project merged recently collected topographic, bathymetric, and acoustic elevation data along the entire California coastline from approximately the 10 meter elevation contour out to California's 3 mile state water's boundary.Topographic LiDAR:The topographic lidar data used in this merged project was the 2009-2011 CA Coastal Conservancy Lidar Project.

NDBC has installed approximately 50 C-MAN stations on lighthouses, at capes and beaches, on near shore islands, and on offshore platforms. NDBC has deployed over 100 moored (a.k.a., weather) buoys in coastal and offshore waters from the western Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean around Hawaii, and from the Bering Sea to the South Pacific. C-MAN and moored buoy data typically include barometric pressure, wind direction, speed and gust, and air temperature; however, some C-MAN stations are equipped to also measure seawater temperature, water level, waves, and relative humidity. Moored buoys measure wave energy spectra from which NDBC derives significant wave height, dominant wave period, and average wave period. In addition, many moored buoys measure the direction of wave propagation. In collaboration, NDBC and the National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) are archiving these data from C-MAN and moored buoys. This NODC Accession is part of the collaboration and it contains netCDF (version 4) files with the data collected during June 2013.SCCF RECON DataReson 8101ER multibeam Data were collected from 13 June-08 July 2005 aboard NOAA Survey Launch Acoustic Habitat Investigator (AHI) at Niihau, Penguin Bank, and Molokai in the Main Hawaiian Islands during cruise AHI-05-04.

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or equivalent entity, and were defined by local participants as part of the 2010 Census Participant Statistical Areas Program. The Census Bureau delineated the census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where all the potential participants declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of census data and comparison back to previous decennial censuses. Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. When first delineated, census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new development, and so forth, may require boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth, or combined as a result of substantial population decline. Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features. They may follow legal boundaries such as minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries in some States and situations to allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses. State and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard census geographic hierarchy. In a few rare instances, a census tract may consist of noncontiguous areas. These noncontiguous areas may occur where the census tracts are coextensive with all or parts of legal entities that are themselves noncontiguous. For the 2010 Census, the census tract code range of 9400 through 9499 was enforced for census tracts that include a majority American Indian population according to Census 2000 data and/or their area was primarily covered by federally recognized American Indian reservations and/or off-reservation trust lands; the code range 9800 through 9899 was enforced for those census tracts that contained little or no population and represented a relatively large special land use area such as a National Park, military installation, or a business/industrial park; and the code range 9900 through 9998 was enforced for those census tracts that contained only water area, no land area.Data.Illinois.gov | Open IllinoisDynamic network of business schools and management development professionals that facilitates learning, accreditation, debate and exchange on best practicesConsistent, historic, and up-to-date ground-water data, such as water levels collected at wells and springs, are available from the USGS National Water Information System as graphs, tables, or files to download.Consistent, historic, and up-to-date ground-water data, such as water levels collected at wells and springs, are available from the USGS National Water Information System as graphs, tables, or files to download.The New Hampshire Hydrography Dataset (NHHD) is a feature-based database that interconnects and uniquely identifies the stream segments or reaches that make up the state's surface water drainage system.

After each decennial census, the Census Bureau delineates urban areas that represent densely developed territory, encompassing residential, commercial, and other nonresidential urban land uses. In general, this territory consists of areas of high population density and urban land use resulting in a representation of the "urban footprint." There are two types of urban areas: urbanized areas (UAs) that contain 50,000 or more people and urban clusters (UCs) that contain at least 2,500 people, but fewer than 50,000 people (except in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam which each contain urban clusters with populations greater than 50,000). Each urban area is identified by a 5-character numeric census code that may contain leading zeroes.NCBO Wiki (en)Solid state detectors with pulse height discrimination measure proton, alpha-particle, and electron fluxes. E1 and I1 channels are responding primarily to trapped outer-zone particles. The I2 channel may occasionally respond to trapped particles during magnetically disturbed conditions. The remaining proton integrals measure fluxes originating outside the magnetosphere from the Sun or the heart of the Galaxy.Users of GOES particle data should be aware that significant secondary responses may exist in the particle data, i.e. responses from other particles and energies and from directions outside the nominal detector entrance aperture. The integrated protons displayed in these plots have been partially corrected for these effects. The electron detector responds significantly to protons above 32 MeV. Electron plots from GOES-8 to GOES-12 use data that have been corrected for this, earlier plots use uncorrected data. All electron data become unreliable during ion storms.Optical validation data were collected using a Tethered Optical Assessment Device (TOAD), an underwater sled equipped with an underwater digital video camera and lights, in the Saipan Anchorage area.

ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) are approximate area representations of U.S. Postal Service (USPS) ZIP Code service areas that the Census Bureau creates to present statistical data for each decennial census. The Census Bureau delineates ZCTA boundaries for the United States, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands once each decade following the decennial census. Data users should not use ZCTAs to identify the official USPS ZIP Code for mail delivery. The USPS makes periodic changes to ZIP Codes to support more efficient mail delivery. The Census Bureau uses tabulation blocks as the basis for defining each ZCTA. Tabulation blocks are assigned to a ZCTA based on the most frequently occurring ZIP Code for the addresses contained within that block. The most frequently occurring ZIP Code also becomes the five-digit numeric code of the ZCTA. These codes may contain leading zeros. Blocks that do not contain addresses but are surrounded by a single ZCTA (enclaves) are assigned to the surrounding ZCTA. Because the Census Bureau only uses the most frequently occurring ZIP Code to assign blocks, a ZCTA may not exist for every USPS ZIP Code. Some ZIP Codes may not have a matching ZCTA because too few addresses were associated with the specific ZIP Code or the ZIP Code was not the most frequently occurring ZIP Code within any of the blocks where it exists. The ZCTA boundaries in this release are those delineated following the 2010 Census.This dataset contains stable isotope ratio data of pelagic invertebrates from plankton net tows collected during HLY0802.

Gridded (5 m cell size) multibeam bathymetry collected aboard NOAA Ship Hiialaka'i and R/V AHI. Bathymetry values shallower than 25 m were derived by gauging the relative attenuation of blue and green spectral radiance as a function of depth. A multiple linear regression analysis of linearized blue and green band spectral values against depth determined the variables of y-intercept, blue slope and green slope values. Variables then used in multivariate slope intercept formula to derive depth. Variables were adjusted to improve the statistical accuracy and spatial coverage of the final derived bathymetry product. Digital image processing to derive depths conducted with the ENVI 4.3 software program while data editing and integration was performed using ArcGIS 9.3.

Goliath grouper has been overfished to the extent that the IUCN (World Conservation Union) has classified it as "critically endangered". The species was protected in the southeastern U.S. in 1990 through action by Gulf of Mexico and the South Atlantic Fishery Management Councils and the National Marine Fisheries Service. Since that time there has been a steady recovery. The primary purpose of these goliath grouper studies was to provide an understanding of adult ecology and behavior so that the population could be managed sustainably. Investigations involved; 1) distribution throughout the southeastern U.S., 2) regional densities in Florida, 3) habitat characteristics, 4) movement patterns, 5) regional size distributions, 6) diet and trophic patterns, and 7) spawning biology. The autors found that the vast majority of the goliath grouper population of the southeastern U.S. is restricted to Florida waters, mostly south Florida. Population recovery began off southwest Florida in the area of abundant juvenile habitat, the Ten Thousand Islands, and expanded to the north and east to southeast Florida, especially off Palm Beach County where spawning aggregations now exist. Goliath grouper prefer high relief habitat with extensive holes and caves large enough to accommodate adults, except in coral reef habitat where population densities are relatively sparse. Except for spawning migrations they display strong site fidelity. Goliath grouper feed mostly on crabs (over 60% of the diet) and especially mud crabs and swimming crabs. Fishes dominating the diet are mostly sedentary species such as toadfish, boxfish, and burrfish. They are not apex predators, but instead feed at a relatively low trophic level, similar to that of pinfish (Lagodon rhomboides). According to the bioenergetics model adult goliath grouper food consumption per day is very low, but additional data are needed to reduce uncertainty. Spawning occurs in aggregations during the late summer through early fall (August through October). Night-time sounds produced by goliath grouper during this period (and no other) appear directly related to spawning and may be useful in determining spawning areas, spawning season, and frequency. The researchers confirmed night-time spawning by collecting goliath grouper eggs (verified genetically) in the late evening and early morning downstream from spawning aggregations during the last quarter moon in the Atlantic and during the new moon in the Gulf. Quantitative reef survey data on the regional population densities of goliath grouper in Florida was concordant with semi-quantitative Reef Environmental Education Foundation (REEF) data; this result will reduce uncertainty about the use of REEF's population density data for future stock assessments.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

(90 deg W, 0.5 deg S) Coral radiocarbon (Delta-14C) on untreated, low-speed drilled samples. Precision is +/- 4 per mil as documented by an in-house homogenized coral standard, and presented as AGE CORRECTED DELTA-14C [see Stuiver Polach, 1977]. The sample cores were made on a Porites lobata coral, in Urvina Bay, Isabella Island, Galapagos Archipelago by G. Wellington, and supplied by R. Dunbar. Cores were split and cleaned with distilled water. After identifying the major vertical growth axis, the coral was sequentially sampled at 2 mm increments with a low-speed drill. Splits (~1 mg) were reacted in vacuo in a modified autocarbonate device at 90 deg C and the purified CO2 analyzed on a gas source stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer. The remaining sample splits (~7-8 mg) were placed in individual reaction chambers, evacuated, heated, and then acidified with orthophosphoric acid at 90 deg C. The evolved CO2 was purified, trapped, and converted to graphite in the presence of cobalt catalyst in individual reactors [Vogel et al., 1987]. Graphite targets were measured at the Center for Accelerator Mass Spectrometry, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory [Davis et al., 1990]. Radiocarbon results are reported as Delta-14C (") as defined by Stuiver and Polach [1977] and include the d13C correction obtained from the stable isotope results. Analytical precision and accuracy of the radiocarbon measurements is +/- 4" (1s) based on repeated analyses of an in-house homogenized near-modern coral and accepted secondary and tertiary radiocarbon standards. The coral died during the 1982/83 El Nino event. In keeping with the definition of "high-precision radiocarbon" ( less than 3 per mil, 1-sigma) data have been rounded to zero significant figures. The age model for these data was derived from a preliminary delta-13C age model which was then optimized by mapping the delta-18O data to a local instrumental SST record. A similar result was obtained using high-precision [Sr/Ca] analyses on aliquots of the same drilled powders used for d18O,d13C, and Delta-14C. Age model errors are estimated (brute force approach) at +/- 1 month.N/AThe National Consortium for Graduate Degrees for Minorities in Engineering and Science, Inc.

Water depth: 2-4m. Coral species Hydnophora microconos. Time span: 1959-79 at monthly resolution. Files contains stable isotope data presented by Cole and Fairbanks (1990), Mn/Ca data presented by Shen et al. (1992b), and normalized d18O data presented by Cole, Fairbanks, and Shen (1993) for the years 1893-1959. Stable isotopes were measured on untreated coral samples at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory by J. Cole and R. Fairbanks, on a Finnigan MAT-251 mass spectrometer with automated Carousel-48 carbonate device. Values are in standard per mil notation relative to PDB. Isotopic data are given for two corals from the same site, LDGO-39 and LDGO-44. Measurement precisions are 0.08 for d18O and 0.04 for d13C. Mn/Ca measurements were performed at the University of Washington by G. Shen and L. Linn by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometry; only coral LDGO-44 was analyzed for Mn/Ca. Sample treatment procedures are described in Shen et al. (1992b). Average departures from duplicate means are 1.6nmol Mn/mol Ca. Ages for all samples in this file were derived from annual variations in d13C, assumed to correspond with annual rainy seasons as described in Cole and Fairbanks (1990).Density banding confirms these ages for LDGO-44 samples, but coral LDGO-39 did not exhibit clearly annual banding patterns. For Mn/Ca data prior to 1962 in LDGO-44, ages were determined by extrapolation based on density band data, as isotopic data only extends to 1962 in LDGO-44.The North America Regional Reanalysis (NARR) Project is a reanalysis of historical observations using a 32-km version of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) 1993 operational ETA model and ETA data assimilation system (EDAS). The objective is to create a long-term set of consistent climate data on a regional scale for the North American domain. The domain of analyses includes North and Central America as well as small parts of the United Kingdom, Eastern Asia, South America, and areas of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. The period of the reanalyses is from October 1978 to the present and analyses were made 8 times daily (3 hour intervals). Horizontal boundary conditions are derived from the NCEP/DOE Global Reanalysis. Advantages over the widely used NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis (180 km) are its higher spatial and temporal resolutions (32 km grid, 45 vertical layers, every three hours) and better treatment of the land surface. This is achieved through the use of a better land-surface model (Noah LSM), the assimilation of more observational data (precipitation, upper air and surface winds), and through a better representation of the terrain (heights, vegetation, soil type). This data set contains "conventional" atmospheric analyses as well as model-derived fields that contain estimates of subsurface, surface, and radiative properties. This data set is encoded in WMO GRIB format version 1 using the NCEP GRIB table 131. The model used a native, "E-grid" for its calculations, however data were interpolated to a Lambert Conformal Conic projection, also known as NAM 221 AWIPS Grid - High Resolution North American Master Grid (32-km Resolution). All vector components are earth relative rather than grids relative which is the convention for operational NCEP model. The list of fields produced by the NARR ETA model differ from the operational ETA model. NARR data files that are compatible with the Grid Analysis and Display System (GrADS) are available.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

Other geographic information contained in the files includes attributes such as feature identifiers/census feature class codes (CFCC) used to differentiate feature types, address ranges and ZIP Codes, codes for legal and statistical entities, latitude/longitude coordinates of linear and point features, landmark point features, area landmarks, key geographic features, and area boundaries. The Redistricting Census 2000 TIGER/Line data dictionary contains a complete list of all the fields in the 17 record types.The rainfall-runoff erosivity factor (R-Factor) quantifies the effects of raindrop impacts and reflects the amount and rate of runoff associated with the rain. The R-factor is one of the parameters used by the Revised Unified Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) to estimate annual rates of erosion. This product is a raster representation of R-Factor derived from isoerodent maps published in the Runoff Estimates for Small Rural Watersheds and Development of a Sound Design method. Volume II. (Fletcher et al., 1977). Lines connecting points of equal rainfall erosivity are called isoerodents. The isoerodents plotted on a map of Alaska were digitized, then values between these lines were obtained by linear interpolation. The final R-Factor data are in raster GeoTiff format at 800 meter resolution in Albers Conic Equal Area,WGS84, WGS84.The Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) operated the D/V GLOMAR CHALLENGER from 1968-1983, drilling 1,112 holes at 624 sites worldwide. The DSDP was funded by the US National Science Foundation and several foreign countries through the Joint Oceanographic Institutions for Deep Earth Sampling (JOIDES), and was operated by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. The DSDP data management group at SIO compiled a full suite of computerized marine geological and geophysical data files before they were disbanded in 1987, at which time the data files were transferred to NGDC and to the Ocean Drilling Program at Texas A University for distribution.In 1989, with support from, and in cooperation with, the Joint Oceanographic Institutions, Inc., U.S. Science Support Program, NGDC produced two compact discs (CDROM) containing all computerized DSDP data. In 2000, all but the logging and geophysical data were re-released as 1 CD-ROM with an HTML interface. Data are available for free online download. In 2007, the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) transferred digital images of all core photographs and closeup core photographs in their collection to NGDC for archive. Due to their volume, these data are not available online, but are archived and available on request.

The marine minerals project was begun in April of 1983, and ended in 1991. Active compilation of the bibliography ended at NGDC in the fall of 1991. Coding of geochemical analyses at NGDC ended in 1989. The marine minerals database contains geochemical analyses and auxiliary information on present-day marine deposits of primarily ferromanganese nodules and crusts, but also contains some data for heavy minerals, and phosphorites. The NOAA & MMS Marine Minerals CDROM data set, funded by INTERMAR, containing the marine minerals geochemical database and bibliography with access software for PC and Macintosh platforms was released by NGDC in October of 1991. Sources of data include the historic Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) manganese nodule analysis file, the CNEXO ferromanganese nodule analysis file, ferromanganese crust data compiled by the U.S. Geological Survey, and data coded at NGDC from the scientific literature. A placer data set from the USGS is also included. The ferromanganese nodule/crust portion of the database contains over 140,000 element/oxide analyses. Approximately 1,400 heavy mineral analyses and fewer than 300 phosphorite analyses are in the database. The geochemical database is described online through the NGDC server.The geochemical database has been corrected and updated by the International Seabed Authority, sponsored by the United Nations - their geochemical database supersedes the NGDC database.powered by the HUBzero(R) Platform for Scientific CollaborationDescription of method of capturing and tagging manatees in western Florida for tracking by satellite telemetry.

The majority of the sites have been used previously for sediment placement and some footprints have been enlarged to accommodate more sediment. Seven new sites are nearshore placement sites (off South Oceanside outside of a previous USACE placement area, off Batiquitos, off Cardiff State Beach, off San Dieguito Lagoon, off Torrey Pines State Beach, off Mission Beach, and off Coronado). The suite of receiver sites are proposed to maximize environmental sensitivity of long-term sediment placement within the region by spreading the placed sediment volume over more numerous and larger areas to reduce cumulative impacts (i.e., burial of sensitive resources, turbidity near bird nesting/foraging areas).Modifications to some onshore sand placement sites may occur as part of the ongoing Regional Beach Sand Projects (RBSP) II planning effort. Certain cities have indicated a desire for either more or less sediment and for placement at slightly different locations other than those included in RBSP I. Therefore, some of the placement locations currently shown may change slightly in future adaptations to the Coastal RSM Plan.Data created by Moffatt & Nichol (March 2009) and submitted to CSMW by SANDAG as part of the San Diego County Coastal Regional Sediment Management Plan (2009).WFS Service for RGIS dataset American Indian/ Alaska Native Area/ Hawaiian Homeland Areas for Socorro County, New Mexico, 2000 Census (e26514fd-8398-46fd-87e0-4aed81f8b1d2)Non-larval fish captured in MOCNESS tows as part of a few special studies.

The checklist of Austin (1985) treated the marine invertebrates of the southern coast of Alaska to California and since then many new species have been described, many range extensions have been discovered, and considerable changes in higher-level systematics have been made. The checklist we compiled lists over 3,500 species and includes the currently accepted scientific name and its significant synonyms, common names, type localities, geographic and depth distributions, a general statement of abundance in Alaska when known (e.g., rare, uncommon, common, abundant), and general remarks. This checklist will serve as a foundation for future species-specific research. Updated species lists are necessary to reflect the current state of biodiversity knowledge and are thus essential for conservation planning and management. To monitor and predict future changes to marine life, the distribution and abundance of marine species need to be better understood, and this can only be achieved with reliable identifications based on a sound taxonomy. The current status and future directions of Alaskan marine invertebrate biodiversity are briefly discussed.Library Catalog may include: Data Management Plans, Cruise Plans, Cruise Summary Reports, Scientific "Quick Look Reports", Video Annotation Logs, Image Collections, Highlight Images, Video Collections, Highlight Video Clips, Dive Plans, Dive Summary Reports, Maps, Essays, News Articles, Presentations, Education Lesson Plans, Biographies, Web Logs/Summaries.powered by the HUBzero(R) Platform for Scientific CollaborationJoomla! - the dynamic portal engine and content management systemThe design of this field mission is three fold: (1) to spatially characterize the distribution, abundance and size of both reef fishes and macro invertebrates within and around the waters of the Flower Gardens National Marine Sanctuary using, (2) to relate this information to in-situ data collected on associated habitat parameters and (3) to use hydroacoustics technologies for a comprehensive assessment of East and West Bank. This information collected will be used to evaluate the utility of an experimental fishing closure on one of the most pristine reefs under US jurisdiction in the tropical Western Atlantic.

Polygon boundaries that provide areas to be rotated for entry of timber inventory and management. Stand is defined as a spatially continuous group of trees and associated vegetation having similar structures and growing under similar soil and climatic conditions.Vegetation polygons support Forest Service vegetation data management and analysis. Vegetation data is critical in support of land management; whether it be for wildlife habitat analysis, fire and fuels management, watershed management, or timber production. A vegetation polygon is a logical sampling unit; a logical area of land on which to describe vegetation conditions. Over time, data is collected for some or all of these polygons. Data such as canopy cover or forest type may be derived for each polygon via satellite image processing or photo interpretation. Field crews may be sent to a selection of polygons to collect detailed data where individual trees are measured or down woody material is measured along transects. The amount and currency of data describing each vegetation polygon varies widely since it is cost-prohibitive to maintain detailed and current data for all polygons at any point in time. Data for some polygons may be more than 10 years old, while data for other polygons may have been collected yesterday.

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. County subdivisions are the primary divisions of counties and their equivalent entities for the reporting of Census Bureau data, and they include legally minor civil divisions (MCDs) and statistical census county divisions (CCDs), and unorganized territories. For the 2010 Census, the legal MCDs are the primary governmental and/or administrative divisions of counties in 29 States and Puerto Rico; Tennessee changed from having CCDs for Census 2000 to having MCDs for the 2010 Census. In MCD States where no MCD exists or is not defined, the Census Bureau creates statistical unorganized territories to complete coverage. The entire area of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas is covered by county subdivisions. The boundaries of all 2010 Census legal MCDs are as of January 1, 2010 as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS). For the 2010 Census, CCDs or their equivalents are delineated in 21 States. The boundaries of all 2010 Census statistical CCDs were delineated as part of the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP).WMSWMSAn aerial photograph is a photograph of the earth's surface taken with a camera mounted in an airplane.

The MTDB provides seamless national coverage with no overlaps or gaps between parts. Each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or it can be combined with shapefiles for other counties to cover a region or the entire nation. The Address Ranges Feature Shapefile (ADDRFEAT.dbf) contains the geospatial edge geometry and attributes of all unsuppressed address ranges for a county or county equivalent area. The term "address range" refers to the collection of all possible structure numbers from the first structure number to the last structure number and all numbers of a specified parity in between along an edge side relative to the direction in which the edge is coded. Single-address address ranges have been suppressed to maintain the confidentiality of the addresses they describe. Multiple coincident address range feature edge records are represented in the shapefile if more than one left or right address ranges are associated to the edge. The ADDRFEAT shapefile contains a record for each address range to street name combination. Address range associated to more than one street name are also represented by multiple coincident address range feature edge records. Note that the ADDRFEAT shapefile includes all unsuppressed address ranges compared to the All Lines Shapefile (EDGES.shp) which only includes the most inclusive address range associated with each side of a street edge. The TIGER/Line Shapefiles contain potential address ranges, not individual addresses. The address ranges in the TIGER/Line Shapefiles are potential ranges that include the full range of possible structure numbers even though the actual structures may not exist.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

Links to ground-water data, hydrographs, and levels.The National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) established the Coastal-Marine Automated Network (C-MAN) for the National Weather Service in the early 1980's. NDBC has installed approximately 50 C-MAN stations on lighthouses, at capes and beaches, on near shore islands, and on offshore platforms. NDBC has deployed over 100 moored (a.k.a., weather) buoys in coastal and offshore waters from the western Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean around Hawaii, and from the Bering Sea to the South Pacific. C-MAN and moored buoy data typically include barometric pressure, wind direction, speed and gust, and air temperature; however, some C-MAN stations are equipped to also measure seawater temperature, water level, waves, and relative humidity. Moored buoys measure wave energy spectra from which NDBC derives significant wave height, dominant wave period, and average wave period. In addition, many moored buoys measure the direction of wave propagation. In collaboration, NDBC and the National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) are archiving these data from C-MAN and moored buoys. This NODC Accession is part of the collaboration and it contains netCDF (version 4) files with the data collected during March 2013.Geographic analysis of the changes in storage and release of carbon in this large area as land use patterns, especially agriculture, have changed.The US Voluntary Observing Ships (VOS) report surface marine observations in both real-time (FM-13 ship format) and delayed-mode (International Maritime Meteorological Tape - IMMT format). To do this, most operating vessels use e-logbook software that allows an observer to enter information, then the software can transmit a real-time report as well as save the same report in a different format to the ship's hard drive for later access, i.e. delayed mode observation (DM). Once in port, all DM reports stored on the hard drive are retrieved and sent to the National Climatic Data Center for archiving and processing.

Gridded (5 m cell size) multibeam bathymetry collected aboard NOAA Ship Hiialaka'i and R/V AHI. Lidar bathymetry were collected by the Naval Oceanographic Office. Bathymetry values shallower than 25 m were derived by gauging the reletive attenuation of blue and green spectral radiance as a function of depth. A multiple linear regression analysis of linearized blue and green band spectral values against depth determined the variables of y-intercept, blue slope and green slope values. Variables then used in multivariate slope intercept formula to derive depth. Variables were adjusted to improve the statistical accuracy and spatial coverage of the final derived bathymetry product.

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Block Groups (BGs) are defined before tabulation block delineation and numbering, but are clusters of blocks within the same census tract that have the same first digit of their 4-digit census block number from the same decennial census. For example, Census 2000 tabulation blocks 3001, 3002, 3003,.., 3999 within Census 2000 tract 1210.02 are also within BG 3 within that census tract. Census 2000 BGs generally contained between 600 and 3,000 people, with an optimum size of 1,500 people. Most BGs were delineated by local participants in the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP). The Census Bureau delineated BGs only where the PSAP participant declined to delineate BGs or where the Census Bureau could not identify any local PSAP participant. A BG usually covers a contiguous area. Each census tract contains at least one BG, and BGs are uniquely numbered within census tract. Within the standard census geographic hierarchy, BGs never cross county or census tract boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of other geographic entities like county subdivisions, places, urban areas, voting districts, congressional districts, and American Indian / Alaska Native / Native Hawaiian areas. BGs have a valid code range of 0 through 9. BGs coded 0 were intended to only include water area, no land area, and they are generally in territorial seas, coastal water, and Great Lakes water areas. For Census 2000, rather than extending a census tract boundary into the Great Lakes or out to the U.S. nautical three-mile limit, the Census Bureau delineated some census tract boundaries along the shoreline or just offshore. The Census Bureau assigned a default census tract number of 0 and BG of 0 to these offshore, water-only areas not included in regularly numbered census tract areas.Comment and discussion on Valve Software's digital distribution platform.This data set contains the Limit of 8(g) Zone line in ESRI Arc/Info export and Arc/View shape file formats for the BOEM Pacific Region.

NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Team, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory, federal, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data in the US Virgin Islands from 3/21/06 to 4/2/06. Data was acquired with a hull-mounted Kongsberg Simrad EM 1002 multibeam echosounder (95 kHz) and processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS software. Data has all correctors applied (attitude, sound velocity) and has been reduced to mean lower low water (MLLW) using final approved tides from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM zone 20 north, datum WGS84. The backscatter component of the bathymetry data were geometrically and radiometrically corrected using Geocoder 2.8 software. Acoustic backscatter mosaics are ostensibly an important piece of information when characterizing surficial seafloor features and delineating benthic habitats. The project was conducted to meet IHO Order 1 and 2 accuracy standards, dependant on the project area and depth. All users should individually evaluate the suitability of this data according to their own needs and standards.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

This diverse group of explorers included a scientific complement of ichthyologists, geneticists, reproductive biologists, oceanographers, and a hydrographer, along with educators, program managers, two journalists, several graduate students, and even a scientific illustrator. Because of their isolation, seamounts act as an oasis in an otherwise barren landscape, and are known to harbor species found nowhere else. Since most seamounts in the New England chain have never been explored scientifically, there was great potential for new discoveries during this expedition.Chemical, physical and profile oceanographic data were collected aboard the F. G. Walton Smith in the Gulf of Mexico from 2010-06-01 to 2010-06-06 in response to the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill event on April 20, 2010, by the Subsurface Monitoring Unit (SMU), which consisted of multiple government and corporate agencies. These data include CDOM fluorescence, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, hydrostatic pressure, salinity, sound velocity, temperature and water density. The instruments used to collect these data included CTD, fluorometer and oxygen meter along with other physical sampling devices. More specific information about each data set is located in their individual metadata records. The CTD data underwent preliminary quality assurance and control procedures at the National Coastal Data Development Center (NCDDC). This data set also contains products created for use in real time analysis and decision support. These products may include charts, graphs, maps, plots, and GIS formatted data files. Cruise level information consisting of data management documents, cruise reports and plans, videos and pictures, and other miscellaneous documentation were gathered by the data managers. (NODC Accession 0069115)Water level records are a combination of the fluctuations of the ocean and the vertical land motion at the location of the station. Monthly mean sea level (MSL) variations were analyzed for 128 stations of the National Ocean Service's (NOS) National Water Level Observation Network (NWLON) having between 30 and 146 years of data. The sea level variations determined are the linear trend, the average seasonal cycle, and the interannual variability at each station. Monthly data up to the end of 2006 were used in the calculation and all stations had data spanning a period of 30 years or more. Since the derived trends include the local vertical land motion, they are spatially variable. Calculated MSL trends range from 9.85 mm/yr for Grand Isle, LA to -16.68 mm/yr for Skagway AK, and are consistent with previous trends published by NOS. Available data from this project include time series plots for each station of the monthly MSL with the seasonal cycle removed, a 5-month average, and the linear trend with its 95% confidence interval which was obtained after accounting for the average seasonal cycle; the seasonal cycle; the Interannual variation of mean sea level for all data to 2006; and the Interannual variation from 1980 to the present (updated monthly). The location and timing of any major earthquakes near stations in tectonically-active areas are noted since an associated vertical offset or a change in MSL trend is possible.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

Towboard surveys are a good method for obtaining a general description of large reef areas, assessing the status of low-density populations of large-bodied reef fish, large-scale disturbances (e.g., bleaching), general distribution and abundance patterns of macro-invertebrates (e.g., COT, giant clams), and for assessing trends in these populations and metrics. A pair of scuba divers (1 fish and 1 benthic diver) are towed 60 m behind a small survey launch at a speed of 1-2 knots and a depth of approximately 15m. Each survey is 50 min long, covers about 2 km of habitat, and is divided into ten 5-minute survey segments. The fish diver records, to the lowest possible taxon, all large-bodied reef fishes (>50cmTL) seen within 5m either side and 10m in front of the towboard. Length of each individual is estimated to the nearest cm. The fish towboard is also outfitted with a forward-facing digital video camera to record the survey swath. The benthic diver records percent cover of coral and macroalgae, estimates benthic habitat type and complexity, and censuses a suite of benthic macroinvertebrates including Crown of Thorns sea stars and sea urchins. The benthic towboard is equipped with a downward-facing digital still camera which images the benthos at 15 second intervals. These images are analyzed for percent cover of coral, algae, and other benthic components. Both towboards are equipped with SEABIRD SBE-39 temperature/depth sensors set to record at 5 second intervals. Latitude and longitude of each survey track is recorded at 15 second intervals using a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver onboard the tow boat. A layback algorithm is applied to more accurately map the position of the divers with respect to the reef environment. This algorithm calculates the position of the divers based on the position of the tow boat taking into account the length of the tow rope, the depth of the divers, and the curvature of the survey track. This metadata applies to the benthic characterization observations.This dataset is a result of the California Ocean Uses Atlas Project: a collaboration between NOAA's National Marine Protected Areas Center and Marine Conservation Biology Institute. The Project was designed to enhance ocean management through geospatial data on the full range of significant human uses of California's ocean environment from the shoreline to the 200 nm EEZ boundary. Data was gathered from regional ocean experts and users through participatory GIS methods.The California Ocean Uses Atlas Project fills a critical information gap in ocean management by providing an unprecedented, comprehensive, consistent and spatially explicit picture of human uses for management agencies, policy makers and stakeholders interested in sound and equitable ocean governance. Using participatory GIS concepts and applications, the Atlas Project generated spatial data and map products illustrating patterns, intensity, and temporal changes in a wide range of human uses in three broad categories of use: (i) fishing, (ii) non-consumptive, and (iii) industrial activities. The resulting datasets depict patterns of ocean use on a broad scale appropriate for a variety of ocean planning and management needs.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

The complexity of habitats supports a diverse assemblage of organisms including approximately 250 species of fish, 23 species of coral, and 80 species of algae in addition to large sponge communities. Understanding and monitoring these resources is critical to both sanctuary inventory and management activities. During the course of the sanctuary's management plan review process, the impact of fishing was identified as a priority issue, and the concept of a research only area was suggested. The purpose of this project will be to provide baseline data for all benthic habitats and communities.WMSRare earth element use is changing with technology.

Recent efforts have been made to merge AUV technology with acoustic telemetry to provide information on the distribution and movements of marine fish. During 2010, we conducted a study in coastal waters near Juneau, Alaska to determine the feasibility of using AUVs to locate marine species under rigorous field conditions, and to compare this approach with traditional vessel-based tracking. Tracking surveys were conducted with a REMUS 100 AUV equipped with an integrated acoustic receiver and hydrophone. The AUV was programmed to navigate along predetermined routes to detect acoustic transmitters within the area. Comparable surveys were conducted with a boat equipped with acoustic tracking gear. Moorings with transmitters at 20-500 m were deployed to provide acoustic targets at known locations and depths. Marine fishes and crabs were tagged to provide mobile targets. Transmitter depth had a major impact on tracking performance. The AUV was equally effective or better detecting reference transmitters in shallow water, and significantly better than the boat for transmitters at deeper depths. Similar results were observed for the tagged animals. Crabs at moderate depths were recorded by both tracking methods, while only the AUV detected fish at depths exceeding 500 m. The AUV periodically had difficulty navigating and maintaining course due to the strong currents and extreme depths in the area. AUVs with greater cruising speeds, increased operating depths, and improved navigation would enhance AUV performance in marine environments.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

The information encoded about these features includes classification and other characteristics, delineation, geographic name, position and related measures, a "reach code" through which other information can be related to the NHD, and the direction of water flow. The network of reach codes delineating water and transported material flow allows users to trace movement in upstream and downstream directions. In addition to this geographic information, the dataset contains metadata that supports the exchange of future updates and improvements to the data. The NHD supports many applications, such as making maps, geocoding observations, flow modeling, data maintenance, and stewardship. For additional information on NHD, go to http://nhd.usgs.gov/.The New Hampshire Hydrography Dataset (NHHD) is a feature-based database that interconnects and uniquely identifies the stream segments or reaches that make up the state's surface water drainage system.

From sardines and anchovies to squid and mackerel, these species are at once the object of dedicated and emerging fisheries and links connecting lower and higher trophic levels in the coastal ocean. These characteristics make an understanding of the dynamics of pelagic nekton communities fundamental to nascent ecosystem-based fisheries management efforts. There is a need to better understand the possibility of climatic variability inducing unexpected responses, such as different species co-occurring and the development of no-analog future communities. This research aims to develop new indicators that will describe how the pelagic nekton communities in the NCC have responded to climatic forcing during the period 1998-2011, with the twin goals of providing critical ecosystem information for fisheries management and expanding the availability of indicators for Integrated Ecosystem Assessments. This project will directly contribute to FATE's goal of creating indices of ecosystem properties and processes that reflect the condition of the ecosystem and the potential for changes in the distribution and habitats of the economically and ecologically important fish stocks in the California Current. This work will help support the Pacific Fisheries Management Council, as they have started to incorporate ecosystem information into fisheries management.

The CLIMAP 18k bp sediment data files were compiled by Oregon State University, and include the work of several major institutions. The files contain micropaleontology in the form of faunal counts of diatoms, planktonic foraminifera, coccoliths, and radiolaria, as well as stratigraphy (percent fine, coarse, total carbonate, oxygen 18 and carbon 13), and geochemistry (percent opal, quartz, and organic carbon), and inferred sea surface temperatures for 635 ocean sediment cores. Data are primarily from the period 18,000 years bp to the present. Time data give upper and lower samples depths, technique, and C14 dates (for total sample, coarse fraction, and fine fraction). Age estimates are given in thousands of years with upper and lower age error estimates. In addition, each data records contains station information. The CLIMAP 18k data set is available for direct download via the NGDC Web server.In early 1996, Quester Tangent Corporation (QTC) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Alaska Fisheries Science Center (in Seattle) formed a strategic alliance to apply QTC seabed classification technology to the problem of groundfish habitat descriptions. The Bering Sea supports about 300 fish species, many of which are demersal species. This stock supports sizeable fisheries, as indicated by landings at the Bering Sea port of Dutch Harbor in excess of 579 million pounds in 1996 and 678 million pounds in 1999 (the highest in the U.S.). By comparison, in 1981 the landing at Dutch Harbor was 73 million pounds. This rapid increase in catch highlights the need for effective management to ensure sustainability. After connecting the QTC VIEW full waveform acquisition system (ISAH-S) to the Simrad EK-500 scientific echosounder on the NOAA ship Miller Freeman, over 9,000 miles of track line data were collected in the eastern Bering Sea between June and August 1999. The raw data consist of digital echo traces of the full water column and seabed substrate. They were collected at two frequencies, 38 kHz and 120 kHz. Based on an average rate of one ping recorded per second, approximately four million individual echoes at each frequency were obtained. The data within this raster set represent the results of processing channel 38_12, which incorporated the 38 kHz frequency data, using a reference depth of 90 meters and stacks of 50 echoes to create a single classified data point through the PCA analysis. A rasterized grid was created from each Q value and then grid stacked to allow RGB representation of each data point in continous Q- space as opposed to categorical class.DIVA-GIS has published Administrative Areas Level 0 in Guinea on their website in support of the Ebola crisis.Describes the monitoring effort and provides real-time data of the current restless activity of the caldera, including earthquakes, ground deformation, and release of volcanic gas and plus link to volcano monitoring techniques.This map layer shows polygons of average annual precipitation in the contiguous United States, for the climatological period 1990-2009.

NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Team and NOAA/NOS/OCS/HSD personnel, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory, federal, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data in the US Virgin Islands from 2/18/04 to 3/5/04. Data was acquired with a pole-mounted Reson 8101 ER multibeam echosounder (240 kHz) and processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS v5.4 software. Data has all correctors applied (attitude, sound velocity) and has been reduced to mean lower low water (MLLW) using final approved tides from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM zone 20 north, datum WGS84. The processed CARIS data was used to generate a CARIS BASE surface based on swath angle with footprint size 3*3. An ASCII XYZ file was exported from the BASE surface and opened in ESRI ArcMap 9 as an XY event. Then the ArcToolbox conversion tool 'Feature to Raster', with cell size 10, was used to generate the final ESRI Grid. While the project was conducted to meet IHO Order 2 accuracy standards, there is a roll artifact (averaging 0.5m high) in the dataset that the user should take into consideration when performing any analysis.Summer rains have remained steady for the past 20 years, but are below the long-term average.

NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Team and NOAA/NOS/OCS/HSD personnel, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory, federal, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data in the US Virgin Islands from 2/18/04 to 3/5/04. Data was acquired with a pole-mounted Reson 8101 ER multibeam echosounder (240 kHz) and processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS v5.4 software. Data has all correctors applied (attitude, sound velocity) and has been reduced to mean lower low water (MLLW) using final approved tides from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM zone 20 north, datum WGS84. Within CARIS, each line of backscatter data was evaluated for bottom tracking and was slant-range corrected. Data was not corrected for gain or transmit power artifacts. Backscatter mosaics were then created using the CARIS shine-through option. Finally, a georeferenced imagery file was exported from the mosaic. While the project was conducted to meet IHO Order 2 accuracy standards, there is a roll artifact (averaging 0.5m high) in the dataset that the user should take into consideration when performing any analysis.TIGER, TIGER/Line, and Census TIGER are registered trademarks of the Bureau of the Census.

Records span the period 1874 through 1988, and represent a total of 73,231 water years of information.Ants represent a functionally important group of arthropods. They are central to many ecosystem processes and are actively involved in decomposition of dead wood, nutrient cycling, plant pollination, seed dispersal, and predation on other arthropods. They also provide are also prey for many wildlife species and other arthropods. The assessment of their status can provide much information useful in monitoring the integrity of biotic communities. Ant communities of nine riparian habitat types within the Big Beaver Creek Research Natural Area (BBCRNA) were sampled with pitfall traps, for five months, in 1995. A subset of five of the habitats was resampled with pitfall traps, for four months, during 1996. A total effort of 17,880 trap-days yielded 2,772 individuals, representing 22 species of ants. Ant species richness in the BBCRNA study area compared to species richness for other areas in Western Canada and the Pacific Northwest. Results indicated that there was very little difference in abundance and number of taxa collected among most the habitat types. Most habitats, with the exception of gravel bars, exhibited relatively low species richness and low abundance. Gravel bar habitats were represented by 13 of the 22 taxa collected during the study, and approximately 45% of all ant specimens collected. Most of the ant species collected in the BBCRNA study area were considered rare and / or vagrant, being collected in low abundance at few sample sites. Seven species, of the 22 taxa collected during the study, comprised over 90% of all individuals captured in each of the years sampled. Four species were considered as habitat generalists, and two species as habitat specialists - Formica pacifica and Myrmica nr. brevispinosa. Both of these species were found almost entirely at gravel bar habitat sites. Indicator values (Dufrene and Legendre 1997) associated with these two habitat specialist species were expectedly high, offering the potential for use in future habitat monitoring.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

NOAA is responsible for archiving and distributing the source data as described in this metadata record.We assembled 1.4 million National Ocean Service (NOS) bathymetric soundings from 98 lead-line and single-beam echosounder hydrographic surveys conducted from 1910 to 1999 in Cook Inlet, Alaska. These bathymetry data are available from the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC: http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov), which archives and distributes data that were originally collected by the NOS and others. While various bathymetry data have been downloaded previously from NGDC, compiled, and used for a variety of projects, our effort differed in that we compared and corrected the digital bathymetry by studying the original analog source documents - digital versions of the original survey maps, called smooth sheets. Our editing included deleting erroneous and superseded values, digitizing missing values, and properly aligning all data sets to a common, modern datum. There were six areas where these older surveys were superseded by compilations of reduced-resolution multibeam surveys. We digitized 12,000 features, such as rocky reefs, kelp beds, rocks and islets, adding them to what was originally available, and creating the most thorough source (n = 18,000) of these typically shallow, inshore features. We also digitized 2,418 km of the mainland and 529 km of island shoreline, generally at a resolution of 1:20,000, and digitized 9,271 verbal surficial sediment descriptions from the smooth sheets. The depth surface, shoreline, inshore features, and sediment data sets are mostly produced at a scale of 1:20,000.The ports (NTAD 2014) are politically defined by port limits or Corps projects, excluding non-Corps projects not authorized for publication.

Towboard surveys are a good method for obtaining a general description of large reef areas, assessing the status of low-density populations of large-bodied reef fish, large-scale disturbances (e.g., bleaching), general distribution and abundance patterns of macro-invertebrates (e.g., COT, giant clams), and for assessing trends in these populations and metrics. A pair of scuba divers (1 fish and 1 benthic diver) are towed 60 m behind a small survey launch at a speed of 1-2 knots and a depth of approximately 15m. Each survey is 50 min long, covers about 2 km of habitat, and is divided into ten 5-minute survey segments. The fish diver records, to the lowest possible taxon, all large-bodied reef fishes (>50cmTL) seen within 5m either side and 10m in front of the towboard. Length of each individual is estimated to the nearest cm. The fish towboard is also outfitted with a forward-facing digital video camera to record the survey swath. The benthic diver records percent cover of coral and macroalgae, estimates benthic habitat type and complexity, and censuses a suite of benthic macroinvertebrates including Crown of Thorns sea stars and sea urchins. The benthic towboard is equipped with a downward-facing digital still camera which images the benthos at 15 second intervals. These images are analyzed for percent cover of coral, algae, and other benthic components. Both towboards are equipped with SEABIRD SBE-39 temperature/depth sensors set to record at 5 second intervals. Latitude and longitude of each survey track is recorded at 15 second intervals using a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver onboard the tow boat. A layback algorithm is applied to more accurately map the position of the divers with respect to the reef environment. This algorithm calculates the position of the divers based on the position of the tow boat taking into account the length of the tow rope, the depth of the divers, and the curvature of the survey track. This metadata applies to the benthic characterization observations.Doppler radar imaging is used for tracking the migration and behavior of bird populations.

Eleven tropical cyclones entered the Gulf of Mexico in 2005, including Hurricane Rita. Hurricane Rita was a Category 3 storm when it passed near the shelf edge banks on September 23, 2005. Several sensitive habitats within the northwestern Gulf of Mexico were close to the path of Hurricane Rita, including Sonnier, McGrail, Geyer, Bright, and East Flower Garden Banks. Hindcast hydrodynamic models estimated wave heights at 20-m or higher on these banks. This may have left some bank caps exposed, even at ~20- to 30-m depths. The implications for catastrophic damage to benthic community structure prompted the Minerals Management Service to characterize the banks in their post-hurricane state. This study characterized and compared the benthic habitats of four banks (Sonnier, McGrail, Geyer, and Bright) and recorded possible hurricane damage at these banks and the East Flower Garden Bank (EFGB). At Sonnier, McGrail, Geyer, and Bright Banks, videographic records were collected by SCUBA and ROV in April and May 2007, at four depth ranges to assess benthic cover to the lowest possible taxonomic level: 22-27 m, 30-36.5 m, 45-50 m, and 55-60 m. Video transects were qualitatively assessed for evidence of hurricane damage. To document recovery from Hurricane Rita at the existing long-term monitoring site on the EFGB, repetitive quadrats and perimeter line surveys were conducted in November 2005 and compared to data collected subsequently in June 2006.Services available at the Geological Survey TRIGA Reactor (GSTR) site in Denver with information on irradiation, neutron activation analysis, fission track radiography, and geochronology and tours of the facility.This database identifies the universe of (permitted) vessels participating in open access commercial and recreational Atlantic highly migratory species (HMS) fisheries, including fisheries for bluefin tuna, swordfish, billfish, sharks, and BAYS (bigeye, albacore, yellowfin, and skipjack) tunas.

Raw survey data included species level abundance estimates.We assembled 1.75 million National Ocean Service (NOS) bathymetric soundings from 225 lead-line and single-beam echosounder hydrographic surveys conducted from 1901 to 1999 in the central Gulf of Alaska. These bathymetry data are available from the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC: http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov), which archives and distributes data that were originally collected by the NOS and others. While various bathymetry data have been downloaded previously from NGDC, compiled, and used for a variety of projects, our effort differed in that we compared and corrected the digital bathymetry by studying the original analog source documents - digital versions of the original survey maps, called smooth sheets. There were several areas where these older surveys were superseded by more recent, higher quality multibeam surveys, mostly from the NOS (n=106). Three of these were unprocessed NOS multibeam surveys in the Sitka area, which we edited and processed into final bathymetric surfaces. We reduced the resolution of these multibeam surveys to 100 m, since some may have sub-meter resolution and many exceed a million soundings, and added them to our bathymetry compilation. In Sitka Sound survey H11118 was missing. Processing and adding its bathymetric data to our compilation filled in a substantial gap in Sitka area, between Kruzof, Krestof, and Middle islands.Search RFP-IV Frequently Asked QuestionsNational Map Viewer, a GIS application, is a Web-enabled portal to the geospatial information contained in The National Map.

Derived from the NED using a hill shade technique, this base map represents a continental view showing shaded relief from USGS NED layers at resolutions of 1/3-, 1-, and 2-arc-second (in Alaska only). This hillshade is actually five separate shaded relief datasets created from the original terrain data. Each shaded relief has different azimuths and altitude values as follows: 0 45, 135 60, 270 45, 315 45, 45 45. These five datasets are then combined into one feature class using map algebra to compute the raster layers using the following equation (shadedrelief1 + shadedrelief2 + shadedrelief3 + (shadedrelief4 x 2) + shaded relief5 / 6). This equation gives double importance to the 315 degrees azimuth and 45 degrees altitude. Color characteristics are the result of applying a color ramp in which RGB values range from near-white (RGB: 255, 255, 252) to brown (RGB: 156, 142, 107). The color ramp was applied with a stretch type of 4.3 standard deviations, since the scale of brightness values range from 130 to 1240. Contrast (24 percent) and brightness (3 percent) enhancements were applied for cartographic purposes.

The NAIP acquires digital ortho imagery during the agricultural growing seasons in the continental U.S.. A primary goal of the NAIP program is to enable availability of ortho imagery within one year of acquisition. The NAIP provides two main products: 1 meter ground sample distance (GSD) ortho imagery rectified to a horizontal accuracy within +/- 5 meters of reference digital ortho quarter quads (DOQQ's) from the National Digital Ortho Program (NDOP) or from the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP); 1 meter GSD ortho imagery rectified within +/- 6 meters to true ground. The tiling format of NAIP imagery is based on a 3.75' x 3.75' quarter quadrangle with a 300 meter buffer on all four sides. The NAIP imagery is formatted to the UTM coordinate system using the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). The NAIP imagery may contain as much as 10% cloud cover per tile. The quarter quads have been reprojected from UTM 11 or UTM 12 to IDTM83 projection (ESPG 102605), mosaicked into 100k tiles, and compressed using ERDAS Imagine for use in ArcGIS.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. The American Indian / Alaska Native / Native Hawaiian (AIANNH) Areas Shapefile includes the following legal entities: federally recognized American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust land areas, State-recognized American Indian reservations, and Hawaiian home lands (HHLs). The statistical entities included are Alaska Native village statistical areas (ANVSAs), Oklahoma tribal statistical areas (OTSAs), tribal designated statistical areas (TDSAs), and State designated tribal statistical areas (SDTSAs). Joint use areas are also included in this shapefile and mean that the area is administered jointly and/or claimed by two or more American Indian tribes. The Census Bureau designates both legal and statistical joint use areas as unique geographic entities for the purpose of presenting statistical data. Note that tribal subdivisions and Alaska Native Regional Corporations (ANRCs) are additional types of American Indian / Alaska Native areas stored by the Census Bureau, but are displayed in separate shapefiles because of how they fall within the Census Bureau's geographic hierarchy. The 2010 Census boundaries for federally recognized American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust lands are as of January 1, 2010, as reported by the federally recognized tribal governments through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS). The State of Hawaii's Office of Hawaiian Home Lands provided the legal boundaries used in Census 2000 for the HHLs, but provided no updates since and none for the 2010 Census although there is strong evidence of HHL land acquisitions and large housing and commercial development on most HHLs. The boundaries for ANVSAs, OTSAs, and TDSAs were delineated for the 2010 Census through the Tribal Statistical Areas Program (TSAP) by participants from the federally recognized tribal governments. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) within the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) provides the list of federally recognized Tribes and only provides legal boundary information when the Tribes need supporting records, if a boundary is based on treaty or another document that is historical or open to legal interpretation, or when another Tribal, State, or local government challenges the depiction of a reservation or off-reservation trust land. The boundaries for State recognized American Indian reservations and for SDTSAs were delineated State governor appointed liaisons for the 2010 Census through the State American Indian Reservation Program and TSAP respectively.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

IKONOS imagery was purchased to support the Pacific Islands Geographic Information System (GIS) project and the National Ocean Service's (NOS) coral mapping activities. One-meter panchromatic and four-meter multi-spectral data were purchased for each study area. The enhanced spectral resolution of multispectral imagery and control of bandwidths of multispectral data yield an advantage over color aerial photography particularly when coral health and time series analysis of coral reef community structure are of interest. The IKONOS imagery was processed to minimize atmospheric and water column effects. Photointerpreters can accurately and reliably delineate boundaries of features in the imagery as they appear on the computer monitor using a software interface such as the Habitat Digitizer.Pacific Science Center inspires a lifelong interest in science, math and technology by engaging diverse communities through interactive and innovative exhibits and programs.Visual monitoring of the sea bed adjacent to the fish farm.Geochemical analyses of rock, sediment, soil, mineral, and heavy mineral concentrate samples in Alaska analyzed from 1962 through 2009Before the Landsat commercialization contract was signed between the Department of Commerce and the Earth Observation Satellite Company (EOSAT) on September 27, 1985, all Landsat activities were handled by the Federal government. After that date all Landsat commercial rights became the property of EOSAT. EOSAT will still retain exclusive sales rights to all Thematic Mapper (TM) data until July 1994, at which time all Landsat data over ten years old will become available from the National Archive at the EROS Data Center (EDC). The first satellite in the Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS) program was launched July 23, 1972 and designated ERTS 1. In 1975 the program was re-designated as the Landsat program to emphasize its primary area of interest, land resources. The mission of Landsat is to provide for repetitive acquisition of high resolution multispectral data of the earth's surface on a global basis. The complete Landsat system consists of an observation platform in a near-polar Earth orbit and ground installations to receive, process and distribute the data provided by the sensors carried on the satellite. The platform carries two remote sensor systems and a data relay system along with attitude-control and orbit-adjust subsystems, power supply, transmitters to send the data to ground receiving stations and receivers for ground station commands. The Landsat satellites are in a sun-synchronous, near polar orbit with a ground swath extending 185 km (115 miles) in both directions. Landsat 4 and 5 are inclined 98 degrees, have an orbital cycle of 16 days and an equatorial crossing of 9:45AM local time. The altitude of the satellites is 705 km (437 miles) for both Landsats 4 and 5. The Landsat platforms operate from a sun-synchronous, near polar orbit imaging the same 185 km (115 miles) ground swath every 16 days. Thematic Mapper (TM) data are received directly from Landsats 4 and 5 by a network of 15 worldwide ground stations. Also, data are transmitted via a Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS) to its ground terminal at White Sands, New Mexico and then relayed via a domestic communications satellite (DOMSAT) to the EOSAT data processing facility in Lanham, Maryland. TM data are processed for radiometric and geometric corrections at the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC).Web-based analytical facility designed to integrate data relevant to flood emergencies in Puerto Rico.This Web Coverage Service (WCS) is one of the multiple MODAPS data service instances used to provide gridded Level 3 daily MODAPS data products.

Collection and management of fisheries dependent data are distributed throughout NOAA Fisheries, State Fisheries, management agencies and regional Fisheries Information Networks (FINs). The distributed nature of NOAA Fisheries information systems, differences in collection authorities and confidentiality requirements increases the importance of this flexible technical architecture that can meet the changing needs for information at national, regional and local levels of resolution. At the same time, the technical architecture is scalable to meet enterprise wide requirements for management of other types of fisheries data and fisheries independent data. Currently available via FOSS are the summarized, non-confidential, annual Commercial Landings by state as provided through the Atlantic Coastal Cooperative Statistics Program (ACCSP), the Gulf of Mexico Fisheries Information Network (GulfFIN). Recreational Landings estimates are available and provided via NMFS Headquarters. In FY2011, FOSS will be expanded to include all commercial landings nationally.These data represent the geographic area described in Title 50 CFR Part 622.35(b)(1), Fisheries of the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico, and South Atlantic, Subpart B - Reef Fish Resources of the Gulf of Mexico, Gear restricted areas, Seasonal prohibitions applicable to bottom longline fishing for Gulf reef fish, as of 07/01/13.Homepage for the research on occurrence, movement, flux, fate, and effects of agricultural chemicals, such as pesticides, in 25 states by the Midcontinent Agricultural Chemical Research Project (MACRP) with links to study results and publications.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

A complete Reforecast of CFS version 2, over the 30-year period (1981-2011) has been created in order to provide stable calibration and skill estimates of the new system, for operational seasonal and sub seasonal prediction at NCEP. Coupled full 9-month forecasts from initial conditions every 5 days apart (for all 4 cycles on that day) have been made for each calendar year with the T126L64 GFS with half-hourly coupling to the ocean (MOM4 at 0.25 degree equatorial, 0.5 degree global). Total number of 9-month forecasts is 73x4 for each year, amounting to 8468 forecast runs for the full period. In addition to the 9-month runs, there is a full season run from every 0Z cycle over a 12-year period (1999-2010) for a total of 4380 runs. There is also a short 45-day forecast from every 6Z, 12Z and 18Z cycle over the same 12-year period (1999-2010) for a total of 13140 runs.Dr. Christopher Jenkins of the University of Colorado Institute for Arctic and Alpine Research (INSTAAR), produced this data hypercube derived from the prime data (exclusive of G.R.A.P.E. and logging data) of the Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP). The Deep-Sea Drilling Project legacy data on the lithologies and physical properties of core recoveries is reprocessed into a uniformly formatted, integrated dataset which can be worked on in a wide range of software applications for query, analysis, mapping and visualization. The goal is to create a dataset which is able to be used efficiently across many science disciplines, especially in the fields of global change, ocean management and earth sciences research. The hypercube data model allows scientists and others to easily comprehend and work with the data layout and content. The integration has employed methods of standardization, linguistic parsing, error trapping, uncertainty analysis, and presentation that have developed and been validated over a decade of use in dbSEABED, for marine ecology, resources, engineering, research and survey. Nevertheless integration of the DSDP dataset has been challenging, not all the DSDP data could be treated successfully.Modest declines in rainfall, accompanied by increases in air temperatures, declining farmland per person, along with trends in population and agriculture could lead to a 30% reduction in per capita cereal production by 2025.The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) modeled the distribution of terrestrial ecosystems for the contiguous United States using a standardized, deductive approach to associate unique physical environments with ecological systems characterized in NatureServe's Ecological Systems of the United States classification (Comer et al., 2003). This approach was first developed for South America (Sayre et al., 2008) and is now being implemented globally (Sayre et al., 2007). Unique physical environments were delineated from a massive biophysical stratification of the nation into the major structural components of ecosystems: biogeographic regions (Cress et al., 2008c), land surface forms (Cress et al., 2008a), surficial lithology (Cress et al., 2008d), and topographic moisture potential (Cress et al., 2008b). Each of these structural components was mapped for the contiguous United States and then spatially combined to produce ecosystem structural footprints which represented unique abiotic (physical) environments. Among 49,168 unique structural footprint classes, 13,482 classes which met a minimum pixel count threshold (20,000 pixels) were aggregated into 419 NatureServe ecosystems through semi-automated labeling process using rule set formulations for attribution of each ecosystem.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

This count of every resident in the United States was mandated by Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution and all households in the U.S. and individuals living in group quarters were required by law to respond to the 2010 Census questionnaire. The data collected by the decennial census determine the number of seats each state has in the U.S. House of Representatives and is also used to distribute billions in federal funds to local communities. The questionnaire consisted of a limited number of questions but allowed for the collection of information on the number of people in the household and their relationship to the householder, an individual's age, sex, race and Hispanic ethnicity, the number of housing units and whether those units are owner- or renter-occupied, or vacant. The first wave of results for sub-state geographic areas in New Mexico was released on March 15, 2011, through the Redistricting Data (PL94-171) Summary File. This batch of data covers the state, counties, places (both incorporated and unincorporated communities), tribal lands, school districts, neighborhoods (census tracts and block groups), individual census blocks, and other areas. The Redistricting products provide counts by race and Hispanic ethnicity for the total population and the population 18 years and over, and housing unit counts by occupancy status. The 2010 Census Redistricting Data Summary File can be used to redraw federal, state and local legislative districts under Public Law 94-171. This is an important purpose of the file and, indeed, state officials use the Redistricting Data to realign congressional and state legislative districts in their states, taking into account population shifts since the 2000 Census. More detailed population and housing characteristics will be released in the summer of 2011. The data in this particular RGIS Clearinghouse table are for all blocks in Lea County. The data table provides total counts by major race groups and by Hispanic ethnicity. This file, along with specific narrative descriptions and definitions (in Word and text formats) are available in a single zip file.Watches Warnings and AdvisoriesIn March 1983, President Ronald Reagan signed a proclamation establishing an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of the United States extending its territory 200 nautical miles from the coasts of the United States, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. territories and possessions. In 1984, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Office of Marine Geology began a program to map these areas of the EEZ. The U.S. Pacific Coast was the first EEZ region to be mapped and launched GLORIA (Geological LOng-Range Inclined Asdic) mapping program. The area covered by this survey extended from the Mexican to the Canadian borders and from the continental shelf edge, at about the 400-meter bathymetric contour, to 200 nautical miles from the coast. Survey of the U.S. Pacific West Coast EEZ was completed in four consecutive cruises conducted from late April through mid-August 1984. The collected GLORIA data were processed and digitally mosaicked to produce continuous imagery of the seafloor. A total of 36 digital mosaics of an approximate 2 degree by 2 degree (or smaller) area with a 50-meter pixel resolution were completed for the region.Juvenile rainbow trout were fed a diet containing an environmentally relevant mixture of 10 high molecular weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) at a dose of 0.66 or 7.82 mg PAH per g fish per day. At 3, 7, 14, and 28 d, biomarkers of aryl hydrocarbon receptor activation (AHR), hepatic microsomal ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity, and cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A)-associated staining increased 14- to 26-fold and 6- to 14-fold, respectively, in fish fed 7.82 mg PAH per g fish per day. Cytochrome P4501A-associated staining increased 2- to 9-fold on days 3, 7, and 28 in fish fed 0.66mg PAH per g fish per day. Bile fluorescent aromatic compounds served as a biomarker of exposure and confirmed that PAH exposure was consistent over 50 d. DNA damage in blood cells, protein oxidation, and lipid peroxidation in the kidney were biomarkers of oxidative stress and all increased in fish fed 7.82 mg PAH per g fish per day. Fish fed 0.66 mg PAH per g fish per day had elevated DNA damage in blood cells but increased protein oxidation or lipid peroxidation in the kidney were not observed. Challenge with Aeromonas salmonicida, at lethal concentration (LC) 20, decreased survival in fish previously fed either 0.66 mg PAH per g fish per day or 7.82 mg PAH per g fish per day relative to fish fed the control diet. In general, biomarkers of both AHR activation and oxidative stress peaked at 3 to 14 d then declined at 28 to 50 d of PAH exposure and an increase in susceptibility to disease was observed at 50 d. These results link PAH exposure to biomarker responses that may be useful as early indicators of population level responses, such as mortality resulting from an increase in disease susceptibility.

Kelp forests/beds are dynamic, with substantial variability in extent of surface canopy between years associated with storms and other oceanographic conditions (e.g., El Ni o Southern Oscillation). Although many functional values are tied to the presence of kelp canopy, habitat values persist in the absence of canopy (e.g., understory and bottom-dwelling algae, invertebrates, and cryptic fish species). Therefore, constraints maps in this document are based on historic occurrence and substrate.Kelp plants are vulnerable to vessel impacts (propellers, anchoring) resulting in frond entanglement or dislodgement of holdfasts. Kelp forest and associated understory vegetation also are sensitive to changing light levels and are limited when light transmission is substantially impaired. Light reduction does not have an impact on adult plants with surface canopies, but can reduce establishment of early life stages and growth of juvenile plants. Therefore, turbidity from sand management is of potential concern if substantial or prolonged. Kelp forests are highly vulnerable to sedimentation impacts, which can potentially damage plants from abrasion and scour or preclude recruitment when sediment accumulates on hard substrate. Kelp forests primarily occur outside the littoral zone, but may experience sedimentation during high wave conditions (e.g., storms, El Ni o). Inshore boundaries of kelp forests, which may extend to shallower waters during mild oceanographic conditions, are most vulnerable to sedimentation and dislodgement during storms.Understory kelp occurring inshore of kelp forests are adapted to the relatively harsh environmental conditions in the littoral zone, including sedimentation. However, inshore kelp requires hard substrate for attachment; therefore, persistent sedimentation may lead to habitat degradation or loss. Long-term impacts would not be expected from transient sedimentation given the opportunistic life histories of many inshore kelp species.Sediment management impact considerations for kelp forests/beds include: Potential for substantial sedimentation based on sand volume and proximity of kelp forests/beds; Potential for prolonged turbidity over kelp bed areas; and Potential for equipment damage from vessels and anchoring.Dataset was submitted to CSMW by SANDAG as part of the San Diego County Coastal Regional Sediment Management Plan (2009).WMSGEOTRACES, An International Study of Marine Biogeochemical Cycles of Trace Elements and their IsotopesPaper by Duane Chapman for the 6th International SPMD Workshop and Symposium on a semipermeable membrane device (SPMD) measures contaminants in water by mimicking the parts of fish that cause concentration of specific chemicals in fish tissues.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

As a result, some species specific stock assessment models have a high level of uncertainty, lacking accurate inputs for catch characterization, effort, and quantity of discards. The purpose of this research was to continue to characterize the catch and discards within the commercial snapper-grouper vertical hook-and-line fishery of the South Atlantic and to build on the dataset created during the pilot program. This was accomplished through the use of trained observers placed onboard fishing vessels to collect data quantifying the gear, effort, catch and discards within the fishery. Twelve trips totaling 96 sea da and 966 sampled sets were made onboard ten different vessels from North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and northern Florida. Vermilion snapper (Rhomboplites aurorubens) was the most common kept species followed by gray triggerfish (Balistes capriscus), red porgy (Pagrus pagrus), scamp (Mycteroperca phenax), and red grouper (Epinephelus morio). The most common discarded species were red porgy, vermilion snapper, scamp, Atlantic sharpnose shark (Rhizoprionodon terraenovae), and red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus). This project was only successful because of the cooperation and assistance of the commercial snapper-grouper fleet throughout the South Atlantic. With the information derived from this project, the data available for stock assessments will be expanded and the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council and NOAA Fisheries will be able to better assess the impact of discards on the snapper-grouper fishery.Powered by the HUBzero(R) Platform for Scientific CollaborationSedimentary characteristics of 228 tsunami deposits, drawn from published accounts, for interpreting prehistorical, historical, and modern tsunami deposits, and for the development of criteria to identify tsunami deposits in the geologic record.Python 2.7.8 documentation Search Python 2.7.8 documentationThe goal of this project is to provide a preliminary overview, at a National scale, the relative susceptibility of the Nation's coast to sea-level rise through the use of a coastal vulnerability index (CVI).

If civilian authorities in surrounding areas volunteered information about these systems or if adding a military PSAP was necessary to fill a hole in civilian provided data, TGS included it in this dataset. Otherwise military installations are depicted as being covered by one or more adjoining civilian emergency telephone systems. In some cases areas are covered by more than one PSAP boundary. In these cases, any of the applicable PSAPs may take a 911 call. Where a specific call is routed may depend on how busy the applicable PSAPS are (i.e. load balancing), operational status (i.e. redundancy), or time of date / day of week. If an area does not have 911 service, TGS included that area in the dataset along with the address and phone number of their dispatch center. These are areas where someone must dial a 7 or 10 digit number to get emergency services. These records can be identified by a "Y" in the [NON911EMNO] field. This indicates that dialing 911 inside one of these areas does not connect one with emergency services. This dataset was constructed by gathering information about PSAPs from state level officials. In some cases this was geospatial information, in others it was tabular. This information was supplemented with a list of PSAPs from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Each PSAP was researched to verify its tabular information. In cases where the source data was not geospatial, each PSAP was researched to determine its service area in terms of existing boundaries (e.g. city and county boundaries). In some cases existing boundaries had to be modified to reflect coverage areas (e.g. entire county north of Country Road 30 ). However, there may be cases where minor deviations from existing boundaries are not reflected in this dataset, such as the case where a particular PSAPs coverage area includes an entire county, and the homes and businesses along a road which is partly in another county. Text fields in this dataset have been set to all upper case to facilitate consistent database engine search results. All diacritics (e.g., the German umlaut or the Spanish tilde) have been replaced with their closest equivalent English character to facilitate use with database systems that may not support diacritics.Seafloor habitat maps have been created using high resolution multibeam sonar with co-registered backscatter at various locations throughout the Alaska Region. Most of the mapping in the GOA is in the form of postage-stamps ranging in size from 27 km2 to 790 km2. Some of this mapping was in cooperation with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game and the University of Alaska Fairbanks. Such mapped sites in the GOA were generally selected in the areas of fisheries for rockfish (Sebastes spp.). The selection of specific sites to map were influenced by budget and logistic constraints that in some cases limited the fishery habitat mapping to areas near concurrent areas being mapped by NOAAs Office of Coast Survey. In contrast for the Aleutian Islands, a systematic design was used to select sites to map that enabled a relatively substantial area of seafloor to be characterized. In theory such a systematic design allows extrapolation to unmapped areas. Database includes bathymetry and backscatter data files as well as a habitat typing spreadsheet for all areas classified using a deep-water marine benthic habitat scheme modified after Green et al. (1999).The VTORTHO_0_5M_PAN_2008 data includes pancromatic (black and white) orthophotography (orthophoto) at 1:5000 scale (0.5 meter cell resolution).

This was the largest earthquake ever instrumentally recorded. (It was not the largest in terms of dollar damage or number of deaths produced). A damaging foreshock (Mw7.3) had occurred the day before at about 10:02 UTC. The series of earthquakes that followed ravaged southern Chile and ruptured a 1,000 km section of the fault between 37 and 48 degrees South latitude. This rupture was one of the longest ever reported. The earthquake epicenters delineated the SSW-NNE fault that is on shore in the north and submarine in the south. The number of fatalities associated with both the tsunami and the earthquake has been estimated at 5,700. Reportedly there were 3,000 injured; initially there were 717 missing in Chile. Earthquake Damage Accounts The Chilean government reported that 58,622 houses were completely destroyed. Damage (including tsunami damage) was more than $500 million U.S. Dollars. The heaviest damage occurred at Puerto Montt, Valdivia, Rio Negro, Lebu, Concepcion, Maldivia, Alerce, Valdivia, Rinihue, Totoral, and Villarica. Although Chile frequently experiences earthquakes, the buildings were not built to withstand a strong earthquake. Fortunately, the large foreshocks sent people into the streets. This saved some lives, because the main shock came a few minutes after one of these large foreshocks. Many of the buildings and homes were vacant when they fell. Tsunamis The main shock produced tsunamis that were not only destructive along the coast of Chile, but which also caused numerous casualties and extensive property damage in Hawaii and Japan. Abnormal wave runup was noticeable along shorelines throughout the Pacific Ocean area. In Hawaii, 6,600 miles from the epicenter, the tsunami killed 61 and injured 282. The damage there was $75 million. In Japan, the coast of Honshu was especially ravaged. There were 138 deaths, 85 missing, 855 injured, and 1,678 homes destroyed, with a total of $50 million in damage. Reportedly there were 32 missing and presumed dead in the Phillippines. The coasts of California, New Zealand, Australia and Kamchatka were also affected. Associated Geologic Events There were several other geologic phenomena associated with this event. Subsidence caused by the earthquake produced local flooding and permanently altered the shorelines of much of the area in Chile impacted by the earthquake. Landslides were common on Chilean hillsides. Many of these rock falls and landslides occurred in the Andes. The Puyehue volcano erupted 47 hours after the main shock. Chile Earthquake History Chile has experienced other large earthquakes since the 1960 event. Both the March 3, 1985, earthquake and the July 30, 1995, earthquake, had magnitudes of about 8. Historically, magnitude 8 earthquakes in Chile occur every 10 to 25 years. Many of these earthquakes produce tsunamis that often travel far beyond the shores of Chile producing devastation. It is only a matter of time until Chile once again has a "world-class" earthquake whose impact, like the 1960 Chile event, will be felt around the world.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

The fluxes are obtained with the eddy covariance technique, which invo lves correlation of the vertical wind component with the horizontal wind component, the air temperature, the water vapor density, and the CO2 concentration. Instruments used are a fast-response, three-dimensional (3-D) wind sensor (sonic anemometer) to obt ain the orthogonal wind components and the speed of sound (SOS) (used to derive the air temperature) and an open-path infrared gas analyzer (IRGA) to obtain the water vapor density and the CO2 concentration. The ECOR systems are deployed at the locations w here other methods for surface flux measurements (e.g., energy balance Bowen ratio systems) are difficult to employ, primarily at the north edge of a field of crops.Gives map of streamflow conditions in Wyoming with access to streamflow data, real-time, daily and historic, plus information on drought analysis and management.Unknown oceanographic data were collected aboard the THOMAS JEFFERSON in the Gulf of Mexico from 2010-05-23 to 2010-05-28 in response to the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill event on April 20, 2010, by the Subsurface Monitoring Unit (SMU), which consisted of multiple government and corporate agencies.

(NODC Accession 0084596)USCRN "Processed" Data (labeled as "uscrn-processed"): are interpreted values and derived geophysical parameters with other quality indicators processed from raw data (both Datalogger files and/or Raw Data from GOES and NOAAPort) by the USCRN Team. Climate variable types include air temperature, precipitation, soil moisture, soil temperature, surface temperature, wetness, global solar radiation, relative humidity, and wind at 1.5 m above the ground. Many additional engineering variables are also available. These data have been decoded, quality-flagged, and processed into level 1 hourly data (the only applied quality control is rounding some values as they enter the database), and includes additional calculated values such as precipitation (5-minute and hourly), hourly maximum temperature, hourly minimum temperature, average temperature (5-minute and hourly), soil moisture (volumetric water content, 5-minute values at the 5 cm depth and and hourly values at all depths) for all dielectric values in range, layer average soil moisture (5 minute and hourly), and layer average soil temperature (5 minute and hourly). It is the general practice of USCRN to not calculate derived variables if the input data to these calculations are flagged. These data records are versioned based on the processing methods and algorithms used for the derivations (versions are noted within the data netCDF file), and data are updated when the higher quality raw data become available from stations' datalogger storage (Datalogger Files).Project Magnet data include low altitude, high density individual track line surveys, high altitude vector data and regional magnetic anomaly grids.The search engine included in mojoPortal Content Managment SystemThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

Those areas may be proposed for designation as critical habitat.  Critical habitat is a term defined and used in the Act. It is a specific geographic area(s) that contains features essential for the conservation of a threatened or endangered species and that may require special management and protection. Critical habitat may include an area that is not currently occupied by the species but that will be needed for its recovery. An area is designated as critical habitat  after the Service publishes a proposed Federal regulation in the Federal Register and receives and considers public comments on the proposal. The final boundaries of the critical habitat are also published in the Federal Register.WMSEM300 and EM3002D multibeam Data were collected from 15 Jan - 6 Feb 2006 aboard NOAA Ship Hi'ialakai at Johnston Island, Howland Island, and Baker Island in the Central Pacific during cruise HI-06-01 These multibeam data were collected using SAIC ISS-2000 software in the Generic Sensor Format and processed using SABER editing software. Surface sound velocity values were supplied by a Seabird SBE-45 MicroTSG and a SBE-38 remote temperature probe. Sound velocity corrections from a Seabird 911 CTD sensor and motion corrections from a POS-MV vertical reference were applied to the data in real time. Predicted tides were applied to the data in real time: for Johnston Island predicted tides from the NOS CO-OPS web site were used; for Baker and Howland Islands predicted tides based upon the Honolulu tide station (1612340) with a time corrector of 3 hrs 48 min and a range ratio of 3.91.

IODP was an international marine research program that explored Earth's history and structure recorded in seafloor sediments and rocks, and monitors subseafloor environments, building upon the earlier successes of the Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) and Ocean Drilling Program (ODP), which revolutionized our view of Earth history and global processes through ocean basin exploration. IODP expanded the reach of these previous programs by using multiple drilling platforms, including riser, riserless, and mission-specific, to achieve its scientific goals. The IODP was funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation and several countries, only the U.S. component of IODP data is represented in this archive. In 2010, the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) began receiving core data processed through the JANUS data system at TAMU for long-term archival, beginning with Expedition 301.

Photos and/or video were collected between 03/18/2010 and 04/05/2010 along 33 transects south of St. John and St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands. These photos and videos will be manually classified into different habitat classes, and integrated with the abiotic data collected by the acoustic sonar (sound navigation and ranging) systems to develop a benthic habitat map for the U.S. Caribbean. Habitat maps describe the location of habitat features (in relation to the shoreline), their physical composition and the types of organisms that colonize them. Fundamentally, habitat maps provide critical information about the extent, health and composition of marine resources, which is vital for communicating information about the distribution and abundance of species to resource managers, scientists and the p ublic. Habitat maps also support an increasing number of landscape ecology studies, as well as the process of marine spatial planning, including the design and evaluation of marine protected areas (MPAs).WMSThe U.S. National Ice Core Laboratory (NICL) is a facility in the Denver Federal Center, Colorado, for long-term storage, curating, and studying ice cores recovered from the polar regions of the world with information on public tours.Library Catalog may include: Data Management Plans, Cruise Plans, Cruise Summary Reports, Scientific "Quick Look Reports", Video Annotation Logs, Image Collections, Highlight Images, Video Collections, Highlight Video Clips, Dive Plans, Dive Summary Reports, Maps, Essays, News Articles, Presentations, Education Lesson Plans, Biographies, Web Logs/Summaries.CURATEcamp (en)Palmyra Island Monthly Coral Oxygen Isotope Data. 112-yr, monthly-resolved coral record from Palmyra Island (5 deg 52 min N, 162 deg 8 min W).

Every two years, DEQ is required by the federal Clean Water Act to conduct a comprehensive analysis of Idaho's water bodies to determine whether they meet state water quality standards and support beneficial uses or if additional pollution controls are needed. This analysis is summarized in an "Integrated Water Quality Monitoring and Assessment Report" (Integrated Report), which is submitted to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for approval. The report serves as a guide for developing and implementing water quality improvement plans (total maximum daily loads, or TMDLs) to protect water quality and achieve federal and state water quality standards.The AFSC AGEDATA database is a collection of historic and ongoing fish ageing efforts by the Alaska Fisheries Science Center's Age and Growth Program from 1982 to present. The database contains over 900,000 observations of biological and collection data from survey and observer fish specimen collections spanning from 1976 to 2014. Primarily the species aged are comprised of commercially important species of Alaska and the west coast such as walleye pollock, Pacific cod, rockfish, sablefish, and flatfish, although smaller numbers of other species are included as well such as skates, sculpins, and forage fish species. Specimen data includes fish age estimates, fish length, sex, weight, collection coordinates, date of collection, fish ageing methodologies, age reader information, and ageing structure descriptions.Scientific DataThis dataset contains an ESRI Grid representing the rugosity of the bathymetry of the south shore of St. John, including a portion of the NPS's Virgin Islands Coral Reef National Monument in the US Virgin Islands, based on a 1m bathymetric grid. Due to the large file size of the 1m St. John grid, it was divided into four component grids for improved manageability, named stj04_1_1rug, stj04_1_2rug, stj04_1_3rug, and stj04_1_4rug from west to east. Rugosity is defined as the ratio of surface area to planar area and is used as a measure of benthic terrain complexity or "roughness". Rugosity values near 1 represent flat, smooth terrain, while higher values reflect increasing rugosity or terrain roughness. For rugosity grid interpretation, is is recommended that the grid be reclassified according to standard deviation divisions.NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Team and NOAA/NOS/OCS/HSD personnel, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory, federal, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data in the US Virgin Islands from 2/18/04 to 3/5/04. Data was acquired with a pole-mounted Reson 8101 ER multibeam echosounder (240 kHz) and processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS v5.4 software. Data has all correctors applied (attitude, sound velocity) and has been reduced to mean lower low water (MLLW) using final approved tides from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM zone 20 north, datum WGS84. The processed CARIS data was used to generate a CARIS BASE surface based on swath angle with footprint size 3*3. An ASCII XYZ file was exported from the BASE surface and opened in ESRI ArcMap 9 as an XY event. Then the ArcToolbox conversion tool 'Feature to Raster' was used to generate an ESRI Grid of bathymetry. The Benthic Terrain Modeller (BTM) tool, a collection of ArcGIS terrain visualization tools developed by the Oregon State University (OSU) Department of Geosciences and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Coastal Services Center, was used to calculate the rugosity of that bathymetric grid. More information on the specific algorithms used can be found in the BTM's documentation.While the project was conducted to meet IHO Order 2 accuracy standards, there is a roll artifact (averaging 0.5m high) in the dataset that the user should take into consideration when performing any analysis.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

It consists of a subset of the stream segments from the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) Medium Resolution (1:100,000) Flowline.The ASCII datasets contain pressure values measured at 10-min intervals at the seafloor and several subseafloor depths in two "Advanced CORK" hydrologic observatories installed by ODP in 2001 at Sites 808I and 1173B in the Nankai Trough subduction zone. The datasets were downloaded from logger memory using Japanese research submersibles at irregular intervals of 1-2 years. Currently there are 14 total datasets as follows: downloads at 808I in 2002, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2011, and 2012; downloads at 1173B in 2002, 2004, 2006, 2007, 2011, and 2012. They should be of interest to scientists studying seismogenic processes at subduction zones. Please note that much of the data from 808I may be compromised by the lack of seal for the central bore. In addition, several of the valves on both installations were bumped open by a reentry camera frame during deployment, so the first year's installment of data from both sites was compromised until the valves were closed during the 2002 Kaiko operations. There are separate data files for each of the downloads. Each data file has a header of basic metadata that describes the contents of the columns and the respective checks on logger clock drift. Typically, the clock drift was checked just before each download, and the clocks were then reset to UTC immediately after the respective downloads. In three cases, the records of the logger times checks have been misplaced and the drifts computed from other clock checks (consistent from year to year at each site, order 1-2 minutes per year) are reported. Note that the times in the data files have not been corrected for the clock drift. Also, during some of the download operations, there were attempts to calibrate the relative offsets among gauges by opening the seafloor valves to apply seafloor pressure to all the gauges. These are not reflected in the main data files. The installations have battery power for 10-15 years of operation, longer with planned addition of supplemental batteries, so there should be future downloads to add to the archive. There are likely to be future JAMSTEC download opportunities at unpredictable intervals, hopefully every 1-2 years. At approximately 5 Mb/yr, future datasets should be approximately 5-10 Mb in size.The goal of this project is to quantify, at the National scale, the relative susceptibility of the Nation&amp;apos;s coast to sea- level rise through the use of a coastal vulnerability index (CVI). This initial classification is based upon the variables coastal geomorphology, regional coastal slope, tidal range, wave height, historical rates of relative sea-level rise and shoreline erosion and accretion rates. The combination of these variables furnishes a broad overview of regions where physical changes are likely to occur due to sea-level rise.Wikitech (en)Search the library CatalogThe Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) mandates that each fishery be classified by the level of serious injury and mortality of marine mammals that occurs incidental to each fishery is reported in the annual Marine Mammal Stock Assessment Reports for each stock. The LOF is the annual publication that updates these classifications. NOAA Fisheries has developed and implemented fishery classification criteria, which consists of a two-tiered, stock-specific approach. This two-tiered approach first addresses the total impact of all fisheries on each marine mammal stock and then addresses the impact of individual fisheries on each stock. This approach is based on the rate, in numbers of animals per year, of incidental mortalities and serious injuries of marine mammals due to commercial fishing operations relative to a stock's PBR level. The PBR level is defined (50 CFR 229.2) as the maximum number of animals, not including natural mortalities, that may be removed from a marine mammal stock while allowing that stock to reach or maintain its optimum sustainable population. While Tier 1 considers the cumulative fishery mortality and serious injury for a particular stock, Tier 2 considers fishery-specific mortality for a particular stock. Tier 1: annual mortality and serious injury across all fisheries that interact with a stock: If the total is ?10% of the PBR level of this stock, all fisheries interacting with this stock would be placed in Category III. Otherwise, these fisheries are subject to the next tier (Tier 2) of analysis to determine their classification. Tier 2: Annual mortality and serious injury of a stock in a given fishery is: Category I: ?50% of the PBR level Category II: between 1% and 50% of the PBR level Category III: ?1% of the PBR level Category I & II fisheries are then subject to the Marine Mammal Authorization Program, potential take reduction measures, and must carry an observer when requested by NOAA or its designate.The European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) is a European Union agency charged with reducing the risk of maritime accidents, marine pollution from ships and the loss of human lives at sea by helping to enforce the pertinent EU legislation.

Principal discoveries made during the expedition were a natural bridge cave at 215 ft. depth on the northern edge of the main Bermuda platform, a drowned reef at nearly the same depth off the south shore, a sea level notch at 370 ft. at the eastern edge, and regularly spaced vertical rifts and jagged, possibly volcanic, cliffs along the southeastern side of Challenger Bank at depths to nearly 450 ft. All of these features were formed during the Ice Ages when world sea level had retreated to the depths that we reached on these dives.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

These products are available on CD-ROM and the Internet. The goal of the project is to assess the undiscovered, technically recoverable oil and gas resources of the world. Two previously published digital geologic data sets (U.S. and Caribbean) were clipped to the map extent, while the dataset for Mexico was digitized for this project. Original attributes for all data layers were maintained, and in some cases, graphically merged with common symbology for presentation purposes. The world has been divided into geologic provinces that are used for allocation and prioritization of oil and gas assessments. For the World Energy Project, a subset of those provinces is shown on this map. Each province has a set of geologic characteristics that distinguish it from surrounding provinces. These characteristics may include dominant lithologies, the age of the strata, and/or structural type. The World Geographic Coordinate System of 1984 is used for data storage, and the data are presented in a Lambert Conformal Conic Projection on the OFR 97-470-L map product. Other details about the map compilation and data sources are provided in metadata documents in the data section on this CD-ROM.

The data types to be collected include bathymetric and topographic lidar point data, down-looking aerial imagery and hyperspectral imagery. The collection effort will follow the coastline and extend 500m inland and 1000m offshore or to bathymetric lidar extinction, whichever comes first. Topographic lidar data will have a nominal sub-meter post-spacing. Where water conditions permit, the bathymetric lidar data will have nominal 2m x 2m postings. Vertical accuracy of the topographic lidar data will meet or exceed RMSEZ=15 cm. Bathymetric lidar data will have a vertical accuracy of 30 cm, 2-sigma. The aerial imagery will have a pixel size approximately 20cm and the hyperspectral imagery will be provided in 1m pixels containing 36 spectral bands between 375 - 1050 nm with 19 nm bandwidth. The data will be collected on the NAD83 ellipsoid using NGS published monuments as control. Final data will be tied horizontally to NAD83 (NSRS 2007) in geographic coordinates. Vertical measurements will be converted from NAD83 ellipsoid heights in meters to NAVD88 orthometric heights using the current Geoid model at the time of acquisition. Data products from this survey effort will include topographic and bathymetric lidar point clouds in LAS format, an NAVD88 0m shoreline contour, and a series of raster data products including topo/bathy digital elevation models (DEMs), true-color aerial image mosaics, hyperspectral image mosaics, laser reflectance images and basic landcover classification images. Images of water column properties (i.e. chlorophyll and CDOM concentrations) will also be generated. Within 6 months of completing the data acquisition, these final data products will be available for public use in the absence of any unforeseen data processing delays.The USGS structures downloadable data from The National Map consists of data to include the name, function, location, and other core information and characteristics of selected manmade facilities.

This information collected will be used to evaluate the utility of an experimental fishing closure on one of the most pristine reefs under US jurisdiction in the tropical Western Atlantic. Data collected during this mission (pre-closure) will provide baseline information necessary to evaluate closure efficacy and assess whether the closure should become permanent.Links to descriptions, maps, photos, and reports of projects related to studies of the effects of dams and flow regulation in watersheds altered by humans in the state of Michigan including Muskegon and Kalamazoo Rivers and the Seney refuge.To support NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program (CRCP) long-term goals for sustainable management and conservation of coral reef ecosystems, towed-diver surveys (aka. towboard surveys) were conducted by the Coral Reef Ecosystem Division (CRED) of the NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC) as part of biennial Pacific Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program (RAMP) Cruises. 11 towboard surveys (28.1420 km in length), were conducted at Lanai Island during the Main Hawaiian Islands RAMP Cruise HI0610 from July 27 - August 20 2006. Towboard surveys are a good method for obtaining a general description of large reef areas, assessing the status of low-density populations of large-bodied reef fish, large-scale disturbances (e.g., bleaching), general distribution and abundance patterns of macro-invertebrates (e.g., COT, giant clams), and for assessing trends in these populations and metrics. A pair of scuba divers (1 fish and 1 benthic diver) are towed 60 m behind a small survey launch at a speed of 1-2 knots and a depth of approximately 15m. Each survey is 50 min long, covers about 2 km of habitat, and is divided into ten 5-minute survey segments. The fish diver records, to the lowest possible taxon, all large-bodied reef fishes (>50cmTL) seen within 5m either side and 10m in front of the towboard. Length of each individual is estimated to the nearest cm. The fish towboard is also outfitted with a forward-facing digital video camera to record the survey swath. The benthic diver records percent cover of coral and macroalgae, estimates benthic habitat type and complexity, and censuses a suite of benthic macroinvertebrates including Crown of Thorns sea stars and sea urchins. The benthic towboard is equipped with a downward-facing digital still camera which images the benthos at 15 second intervals. These images are analyzed for percent cover of coral, algae, and other benthic components. Both towboards are equipped with SEABIRD SBE-39 temperature/depth sensors set to record at 5 second intervals. Latitude and longitude of each survey track is recorded at 15 second intervals using a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver onboard the tow boat. A layback algorithm is applied to more accurately map the position of the divers with respect to the reef environment. This algorithm calculates the position of the divers based on the position of the tow boat taking into account the length of the tow rope, the depth of the divers, and the curvature of the survey track. This metadata applies to the benthic characterization observations.EM300 and EM3002D multibeam Data were collected from 17 July-08 August 2005 aboard NOAA Ship Hi'ialakai at Niihau, Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Lanai, and Maui in the Main Hawaiian Islands during cruise HI-05-05. These multibeam data were collected using SAIC ISS-2000 software in the Generic Sensor Format and processed using SABER editing software. Surface sound velocity values were supplied by a Seabird SBE-45 MicroTSG and a SBE-38 remote temperature probe. Sound velocity corrections from a Seabird 911 CTD sensor and motion corrections from a POS-MV vertical reference were applied to the data in real time. Predicted tides were applied to the data in real time and observed tides were applied in post-processing. Horizontal accuracy is 5 m (differential GPS correctors applied), vertical accuracy is depth dependent (~1% of water depth), WGS84 datum. These data are not to be used for navigation. Depths mapped range from ~20-1000m.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

Surveys employed diving, technical diving, ROV, and hydroacoustics technologies for a comprehensive assessment of the fish and benthic habitat communities of the East and West Bank. The FGBNMS represents the northernmost tropical western Atlantic coral reef on the continental shelf and support the most highly developed offshore hard bank community in the region. The complexity of habitats supports a diverse assemblage of organisms including approximately 250 species of fish, 23 species of coral, and 80 species of algae in addition to large sponge communities. Understanding and monitoring these resources is critical to both sanctuary inventory and management activities. During the course of the sanctuary's management plan review process, the impact of fishing was identified as a priority issue, and the concept of a research only area was suggested. The purpose of this project will be to provide baseline data for all benthic habitats and communities.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

Better understanding of this phenomenon was deemed very important by the assessment review panel. The vermilion snapper assessments conducted in the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic have experienced difficulties contending with extremely high variances in size-at-age. The primary goal of this work is to collect life history information on red grouper and vermilion snapper. The project will focus on collecting reproductive samples from red grouper and age samples from vermilion snapper. The samples will be taken from the central and southwestern shelf of west Florida, which will complement samples from other areas. Information on habitat will be collected to compare possible differences in life history parameters among different habitat types. The project will conduct 14 eight-day trips over 18 mo to collect gonads and otoliths from red grouper and vermilion snapper. Samples, including length and weight of individual fish, will be collected according to NMFS protocol and delivered to NMFS for analyses. Specific sites will be sampled to allow NMFS scientists to identify potential differences between growth and reproductive rates among the selected sites.The river mileage established by the US Army Corps of Engineers St. Paul District is from Plates 2-13 from the Souris-Red-Rainy River Basins, Red River Type II Study, Red River Main Stem, Regional Floodplain Area.

Industry may include commercial whale watching vessels, charter whale watches, dolphin and/or seal watches.Dr. Christopher Jenkins of the University of Colorado Institute for Arctic and Alpine Research (INSTAAR), produced this data hypercube derived from the prime data (exclusive of G.R.A.P.E. and logging data) of the Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP). The Deep-Sea Drilling Project legacy data on the lithologies and physical properties of core recoveries is reprocessed into a uniformly formatted, integrated dataset which can be worked on in a wide range of software applications for query, analysis, mapping and visualization. The goal is to create a dataset which is able to be used efficiently across many science disciplines, especially in the fields of global change, ocean management and earth sciences research. The hypercube data model allows scientists and others to easily comprehend and work with the data layout and content. The integration has employed methods of standardization, linguistic parsing, error trapping, uncertainty analysis, and presentation that have developed and been validated over a decade of use in dbSEABED, for marine ecology, resources, engineering, research and survey. Nevertheless integration of the DSDP dataset has been challenging, not all the DSDP data could be treated successfully.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities. Hydrographic survey data primarily consist of water depths, but may also include features (e.g. rocks, wrecks), navigation aids, shoreline identification, and bottom type information. NOAA is responsible for archiving and distributing the source data as described in this metadata record.This georeferenced image represents 10 meter resolution bathymetry of an inshore portion of the NPS's Virgin Islands Coral Reef National Monument, south of St. John, US Virgin Islands. NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Team, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory, federal, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data in the US Virgin Islands from 2/1/05 to 2/12/05. Data was acquired with a pole-mounted Reson 8101 ER multibeam echosounder (240 kHz) and processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS v5.4 software. Data has all correctors applied (attitude, sound velocity) and has been reduced to mean lower low water (MLLW) using final approved tides from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM zone 20 north, datum NAD83. The processed CARIS data was used to generate a CARIS BASE surface -akin to a DTM- based on swath angle. Within CARIS, an imagery file with associated georeferencing was then exported from the BASE surface.The project was conducted to meet IHO Order 1 and 2 accuracy standards, dependant on the project area and depth. All users should individually evaluate the suitability of this data according to their own needs and standards.The CAGES program (Comparative Assessment of Gulf Estuarine Systems) is designed to examine the differences between estuarine ecosystems and investigate why some are more productive than others. The program focuses on estuarine areas important to commercial fisheries and includes data on commercial finfish and invertebrate species, as well as other species commonly captured in trawl sampling. This Mississippi dataset is a subset of the CAGES Relational Database which is a compilation of fishery-independent data contributed by natural resource agencies of the Gulf States (Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida). This data set includes data from trawls collected by the Mississippi Department of Marine Resources and the University of Southern Mississippi's Gulf Coast Research Laboratory (MDMR/GCRL), as well as associated hydrographic data. Trawl data were used to calculate CPUE (catch per unit effort) at each station for the years 1973 through 2005.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

This is a proxy method using a sediment trap to collect planktonic foraminifera.Bathymetry for Narragansett Bay was derived from fifteen surveys containing165,184 soundings. Three older, less accurate, overlapping surveys wereentirely omitted, and the overlap from six older, less accurate surveys wasomitted before tinning the data. The average separation between soundingswas 50 meters. The fifteen surveys used dated from 1943 to 1957. The total rangeof sounding data was 1.2 meters to - 58.8 meters at mean low water. Meanhigh water values between 0.9 and 1.4 meters were assigned to the shoreline.Four points were found that were not consistent with the surrounding data.These were removed prior to tinning. DEM grid values outside theshoreline (on land) were assigned null values (-32676).Narragansett Bay has thirteen 7.5 minute DEMs and a single one degreeDEM. The 1 degree DEMs were generated from the higher resolution 7.5minute DEMs which covered the estuary. A Digital Elevation Model(DEM) contains a series of elevations ordered from south to northwith the order of the columns from west to east. The DEM isformatted as one ASCII header record (A- record), followed by aseries of profile records (B- records) each of which include a shortB-record header followed by a series of ASCII integer elevations(typically in units of 1 centimeter) per each profile. The lastphysical record of the DEM is an accuracy record (C-record).The 7.5-minute DEM (30- by 30-m data spacing) is cast on theUniversal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection. It provides coveragein 7.5- by 7.5-minute blocks. Each product provides the samecoverage as a standard USGS 7.5-minute quadrangle but the DEMcontains over edge data. Coverage is available for many estuaries ofthe contiguous United States but is not complete.Chart showing 13 volcanoes on a map of Washington, Oregon, and northern California, along with time lines for each volcano showing the ages of their eruptions.(USGS text) The U.S. Geological Survey has developed a National Elevation Dataset (NED). The NED is a seamless mosaic of best-available elevation data. The 7.5-minute elevation data for the conterminous United States are the primary initial source data. In addition to the availability of complete 7.5-minute data, efficient processing methods were developed to filter production artifacts in the existing data, convert to the NAD83 datum, edge-match, and fill slivers of missing data at quadrangle seams. One of the effects of the NED processing steps is a much-improved base of elevation data for calculating slope and hydrologic derivatives. The specifications for the NED 1 arc second and 1/3 arc second data are: Geographic coordinate system Horizontal datum of NAD83, except for AK which is NAD27 Vertical datum of NAVD88, except for AK which is NAVD29 Z units of metersThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

The data consist of information compiled as part of the U.S. Geological Survey Coastal Vulnerability Index for the U.S. coastline. In this work, the Bayesian network is used to define relationships between driving forces, geologic constraints, and coastal response which are represented by observations of local rates of relative sea-level rise, wave height, tide range, geomorphic classification, coastal slope, and shoreline change rate. Using this information, the BN is used to make probabilistic predictions of shoreline retreat in response to different future sea-level rise rates.Explains how we use lead, where it comes from, and how we might ensure that we have adequate supplies of this mineral commodity in the future.Report on the status of the biota and ecological factors of the inland lakes of the Great Lakes Cluster Parks: Indiana Dunes, Sleeping Bear Dunes,and Pictured Rocks National Lakeshores and Isle Royale and Voyageurs National Parks.

Descriptions were abstracted largely from unpublished laboratory reports and core log sheets contributed to the National Oceanographic Data Center prior to 1975. Descriptions were assigned by Ms. Susie Bershad,and Dr. Martin Weiss of the Marine Geology and Geophysics Branch of NODC, which was transferred to the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) in 1976, at which time compilation ceased. Data are free for online search and download.The U.S. Hourly Climate Normals for 1981 to 2010 are 30-year averages of meteorological parameters for thousands of U.S. stations located across the 50 states, as well as U.S. territories, commonwealths, the Compact of Free Association nations, and one station in Canada. NOAA Climate Normals are a large suite of data products that provide users with many tools to understand typical climate conditions for thousands of locations across the United States. As many NWS stations as possible are used, including those from the NWS Cooperative Observer Program (COOP) Network as well as some additional stations that have a Weather Bureau Army-Navy (WBAN) station identification number, including stations from the Climate Reference Network (CRN). The comprehensive U.S. Climate Normals dataset includes various derived products including daily air temperature normals (including maximum and minimum temperature normal, heating and cooling degree day normal, and others), precipitation normals (including snowfall and snow depth, percentiles, frequencies and other), and hourly normals (all normal derived from hourly data including temperature, dew point, heat index, wind chill, wind, cloudiness, heating and cooling degree hours, pressure normals). Users can access the data either by product or by station. Included in the dataset is extensive documentation to describe station metadata, filename descriptions, and methodology of producing the data. All data utilized in the computation of the 1981-2010 Climate Normals were taken from the ISD Lite (a subset of derived Integrated Surface Data), the Global Historical Climatology Network-Daily dataset, and standardized monthly temperature data (COOP). These source datasets (including intermediate datasets used in the computation of products) are also archived at the NOAA NCDC.This dataset contains well log observations compiled by the Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology, and published as a Web feature service for the National Geothermal Data System.

GAP distribution models are the spatial arrangement of environments suitable for occupation by a species. In other words, a species distribution is created using a deductive model to predict areas suitable for occupation within a species range. To represent these suitable environments, GAP compiled existing GAP data, where available, and compiled additional data where needed. Existing data sources were the Southwest Regional Gap Analysis Project (SWReGAP) and the Southeast Gap Analysis Project (SEGAP) as well as a data compiled by Sanborn Solutions and Mason, Bruce and Girard. Habitat associations were based on land cover data of ecological systems and--when applicable for the given taxon--on ancillary variables such as elevation, hydrologic characteristics, human avoidance characteristics, forest edge, ecotone widths, etc. Distribution models were generated using a python script that selects model variables based on literature cited information stored in a wildlife habitat relationship database (WHRdb); literature used includes primary and gray publications. Distribution models are 30 meter raster data and delimited by GAP species ranges. Distribution model data were attributed with information regarding seasonal use based on GAP regional projects (NWGAP, SWReGAP, SEGAP, AKGAP, HIGAP, PRGAP, and USVIGAP), NatureServe data, and IUCN data. A full report documenting the parameters used in each species model can be found via: http://gis1.usgs.gov/csas/gap/viewer/species/Map.aspx Web map services for species distribution models can be accessed from: http://gis1.usgs.gov/arcgis/rest/services/NAT_Species_Birds http://gis1.usgs.gov/arcgis/rest/services/NAT_Species_Mammals http://gis1.usgs.gov/arcgis/rest/services/NAT_Species_Amphibians http://gis1.usgs.gov/arcgis/rest/services/NAT_Species_Reptiles A table listing all of GAP's available web map services can be found here: http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/species/data/web-map-services/ GAP used the best information available to create these species distribution models; however GAP seeks to improve and update these data as new information becomes available.

The NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service Mississippi Laboratories at Pascagoula and Stennis Space Center and the NOAA National Coastal Data Development Center (NCDDC) at Stennis Space Center began the Hypoxia Watch project in 2001. Scientists aboard the NOAA Research Vessel Oregon II measure seawater properties, such as water temperature, salinity, chlorophyll, and dissolved oxygen at each of approximately 240 locations as the Oregon II cruises the waters south of Pascagoula, MS and then makes its way from Brownsville, Texas, to the mouth of the Mississippi River. A scientist aboard the ship processes the measurements from electronic dissolved oxygen sensors, checks the measurements periodically with chemical analyses of the seawater, then sends the data by e-mail to NCDDC at Stennis Space Center approximately every three to five days. Physical Scientists at NCDDC transform the dissolved oxygen measurements into contour maps, which identify areas of low oxygen, or hypoxia. During the 6-week cruise, as the data is received from the ship, NCDDC generates new maps and immediately publishes them on the web. The first map will usually cover an area off the Mississippi coast, successive maps will add areas of the continental shelf from Brownsville to Galveston, and the final map will usually cover the entire Texas-Louisiana-Mississippi coast. Maps are published every three to five days from approximately June 10 to July 20.Reach File Version 1.0 (RF1) is a vector database of approximately 700,000 miles of streams and open waters in the conterminous United States. It is used extensively by EPA and States,and has been used by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Weather Service for many years. This configuration of RF1 for the geographic information systems community, extends the use of RF1 to ARC/INFO users in the U.S.Geological Survey, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and others. RF1 was prepared by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1982 from stable base color separates of National Oceanographic and Aeronautical Administration (NOAA) aeronautical charts having a scale of 1:500,000. These charts provided the best nationwide hydrographic coverage available on a single scale at that time. They included all hydrography shown on USGS maps having a scale of 1:250,000 with extensive additions, corrections and improvements in detail made by NOAA from aerial photography and satellite imagery. All hydrographic features on those charts were optically scanned from the color separates using a scanner resolution finer than feature line width. The surface water features selected for inclusion in the RF1 database were converted from the scanned raster form to vector form with coordinates expressed as latitude and longitude. Surface water names in RF1 were derived from the source maps and supplemented by names from miscellaneous state maps and maps of the USGS. Many other RF1 attributes are described herein. In the 1980's, RF1 was used by EPA for performing water quality modeling on whole river basins for all of the hydrologic regions in the conterminous United States. In this role, it was used to provide national assessments and overviews of water quality and to provide the foundation for a nationwide stratified sampling frame for performing statistical summaries of modeled and measured water quality on all the surface waters of the 48 States. In the 1980's, environmental data integration was strengthened significantly by EPA using the Reach File. Whereas, STORET had, for many years, integrated the water quality monitoring data of EPA, States, the USGS, and other Federal agencies by agency codes, standard water quality parameter codes, date, time, depth, site coordinates, state, basin, and user-definable polygons, the Reach File provided STORET with the capability to search upstream and downstream to relate the environmental data of many agencies to each other along stream paths. This brought about the ability to integrate ambient water quality at sites sampled by the several hundred official monitoring agencies using STORET in a new and powerful manner. Thus, for example, any and all water quality measurements made by the USGS and stored in WATSTORE were easily accessed via STORET prior to the introduction of the Reach File, but with the Reach File, it became possible to integrate the data from USGS WATSTORE records with the much larger holdings of environmental data from EPA, States and other Federal agencies on a station-by-station basis along stream paths. Stream ordered data integration of this type was important in the development of effluent guidelines pursuant to the Clean Water Act during the 1980's, and is but one example of the new dimension in data integration made possible by the standard reach numbering scheme and the hydrologic networking provided in RF1. Linking multiple databases to RF1 and hence to each other, was accomplished by a process called reach indexing. The process takes advantage of the facts that each reach has been assigned a unique identifier and the stream path for each reach is described in terms of latitude/longitude coordinates. Using simple algebraic processing, each lat/lon point for every point of interest in a database is indexed to the closest point in the nearest RF1 reach. The unique reach number for that reach and its relative position, prorated against the full computed reach length, is placed in the database being reach indexed. From then on, access to all points that have been reach indexed in that indexed database, may be achieved in hydrological order by navigating upstream or downstream through RF1, picking up reach numbers in hydrological order from RF1 and retrieving the points of interest, if present, from the indexed database by reach numbers as the reaches are encountered in the navigation of RF1.powered by the HUBzero(R) Platform for Scientific CollaborationA cells polygon feature class was created by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to illustrate the degree of exploration, type of production, and distribution of production in the United States. Each cell represents a quarter-mile square of the land surface, and the cells are coded to represent whether the wells included within the cell are predominantly oil-producing, gas-producing, both oil and gas-producing, or the type of production of the wells located within the cell is unknown or dry. The well information was initially retrieved from IHS Inc.'s PI/Dwights PLUS Well Data on CD-ROM, which is a proprietary, commercial database containing information for most oil and gas wells in the U.S. Cells were developed as a graphic solution to overcome the problem of displaying proprietary well data. No proprietary data are displayed or included in the cell maps. The data are current through 10/1/2005.The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Pascagoula Laboratory conducts annual longline surveys that encompass 90-365 m, the range of yellowedge distribution. A total of 28-55 yellowedge have been captured (n=238) during each cruise from 1999-2004. A thorough reproductive study requires samples collected from each month of the year, however, NMFS cruises are only conducted in July through September. Therefore, collaboration with a commercial fisherman, Ken Daniels, Jr., was established to collect an adequate number of samples for a successful and conclusive study. The objective of this study was to sample additional yellowedge grouper and combine those samples with fishery independent samples already collected by the NMFS to determine the life history of yellowedge in the northern GOM. This document summarizes the data collected by Ken Daniels, Jr. under this cooperative research agreement. A comprehensive analysis will be found in "Life history, population structure, mortality and potential yield of the yellowedge grouper, Epinephelus flavolimbatus, from the northern Gulf of Mexico" by Melissa Cook, a doctoral candidate at the University of Southern Mississippi.Information concerning status and trends of biological resources, focusing on experimental design and methodsN/AWe estimated mean undiscovered resource volumes of 21.55 million barrels of oil, 44.76 billion cubic feet of non-associated natural gas, and 0.91 million barrels of natural gas liquids in the western Afghanistan Tirpul Assessment Unit.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

The DHW product measures accumulation of bleaching thermal stress that coral reefs experience over a period of 12 consecutive weeks (about 3 months), ending on the day indicated in the product. It is derived from the Coral Bleaching HotSpots product (another key tool in the CRW operational product suite). A Coral Bleaching HotSpot is a specific type of sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly that measures the amount of SST exceeding a static coral bleaching threshold SST; it serves as a measure of instantaneous bleaching thermal stress and shows the occurrence, magnitude, and spatial distribution of the stress. All non-positive HotSpot values are recorded as zeros. The DHW value (again, a measurement of accumulated thermal stress) is, in its most simplistic form, the sum of all of the individual twice-weekly HotSpot values at any particular location, within a 12-week period and with a magnitude of at least 1 degree Celsius, multiplied by the duration of the twice-weekly HotSpot value (i.e., 0.5 weeks). A more complicated formula describing how the DHW value is calculated can be obtained at: http://coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/satellite/methodology/methodology.php#dhw. One DHW is equivalent to one week of SST at 1 degree Celsius above the threshold, or 0.5 weeks of SST at two degrees Celsius above the threshold. Near-real-time satellite data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) on some of NOAA's Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites (POES) were used to generate AVHRR-SST that this CRW product suite is based on. Related details, as well as other important information, are provided in each DHW HDF data file. This product is available in various formats, including static image, animation, HDF data, and Google Earth and is delivered through multiple mechanisms, including websites, ftp, and OPeNDAP, along with time series data in text format at selected locations, known as CRW Satellite Virtual Stations. The DHW product, its detailed description, and its available data formats and delivery mechanisms are accessible at: http://coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/satellite, along with general CRW product information and access to other CRW products.This dataset contains an ESRI Grid representing the rugosity of the bathymetry of Buck Island, on the north shore of St. Croix, US Virgin Islands, based on a 1m bathymetric grid. Rugosity is defined as the ratio of surface area to planar area and is used as a measure of benthic terrain complexity or "roughness". Rugosity values near 1 represent flat, smooth terrain, while higher values reflect increasing rugosity or terrain roughness. For rugosity grid interpretation, is is recommended that the grid be reclassified according to standard deviation divisions.NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Team and NOAA/NOS/OCS/HSD personnel, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory, federal, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data in the US Virgin Islands from 2/18/04 to 3/5/04. Data was acquired with a pole-mounted Reson 8101 ER multibeam echosounder (240 kHz) and processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS v5.4 software. Data has all correctors applied (attitude, sound velocity) and has been reduced to mean lower low water (MLLW) using final approved tides from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM zone 20 north, datum WGS84. The processed CARIS data was used to generate a CARIS BASE surface based on swath angle with footprint size 3*3. An ASCII XYZ file was exported from the BASE surface and opened in ESRI ArcMap 9 as an XY event. Then the ArcToolbox conversion tool 'Feature to Raster' was used to generate an ESRI Grid of bathymetry. The Benthic Terrain Modeller (BTM) tool, a collection of ArcGIS terrain visualization tools developed by the Oregon State University (OSU) Department of Geosciences and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Coastal Services Center, was used to calculate the rugosity of that bathymetric grid. More information on the specific algorithms used can be found in the BTM's documentation.While the project was conducted to meet IHO Order 2 accuracy standards, there is a roll artifact (averaging 0.5m high) in the dataset that the user should take into consideration when performing any analysis.This 34 by 53 inch full-color poster is report WDC for MGG RP-1. In many areas of the global ocean, the depth of the seafloor is not well known because survey lines by ships are hundreds of kilometers apart. Satellites carrying radar altimeters have measured the shape of the ocean along tracks only 3-4 km apart, and from these data we can make very accuratore (+/-3mGal) and high resolution (15km) maps of the marine gravity field. The gravity field mimics the seafloor topography in the 15-160 km wavelength band if sediment cover on the ocean floor is thin. Long-wavelength (greater than 160 km) topography is isostatically compensated and is not correlated with the gravity field. In addition, the satellite gravity field and the available depth measurements were used to determine the correlation between gravity and the seafloor topography. By applying this correlation to the gravity field we predict seafloor topography in the 15-160 km wavelength band. This topography is combined with a long-wavelength component estimated directly from ship depth measurements. The result reveals many new features and is within +/- 100m of actual depths in many cases. The Predicted Seafloor Topography derived from the depths estimated from Satellite Altimetry in combination with measured trackline bathymetry is an inferred data set and is not true bathymetry. It is, however, the best estimate of seafloor topography available resulting from satellite gravity data and actual ship depth measurements. These data are intended for scientific research and should not be used for navigational purposes. Additional software is required in order to manipulate the data or produce your own graphic images. Poster and CD-ROM products are available for both gravity anomaly and estimated seafloor topography of several regions.

Data is typically collected at 1800 second intervals for a duration of 2 years using a SBE39 Temperature Recorder (Sea-Bird Electronics, Inc., www.seabird.com). When a STR is recovered, a new one is typically deployed in the same place. Time series data combining multiple deployments from a given site may also be available. Please contact CRED with any questions. For program information see the web site http://www.pifsc.noaa.gov/cred/oceanography.phpSmall wetlands in this large area have hosted migratory birds for a long time, but with changes in agricultural practice and regional climate those habitats may not remain hospitable to the wild populations.Climate Audit Search Climate Audit - by Steve McIntyreWxWiki (en)The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities. Hydrographic survey data primarily consist of water depths, but may also include features (e.g. rocks, wrecks), navigation aids, shoreline identification, and bottom type information. NOAA is responsible for archiving and distributing the source data as described in this metadata record.Optical validation data were collected using a Tethered Optical Assessment Device (TOAD), an underwater sled equipped with an underwater digital video camera and lights, in the Saipan Anchorage area. Data were collected using TOAD during two and a half weeks of small boat-based TOAD deployments. A report detailing results of the study was generated to assist the Military Sealift Command in their efforts to increase the number of pre-position vessels stationed there.The mosaic image contained in this file is comprised of the seafloor reflectance generated from the bathymetric laser energy. It contains multiple flightlines that were collected by the Compact Hydrographic Airborne Rapid Total Survey (CHARTS) system along the coast of New York. CHARTS integrates topographic and bathymetric lidar sensors, a digital camera, and a hyperspectral scanner on a single remote sensing platform for use in coastal mapping and charting activities. Data coverage generally extends along the coastline from the waterline inland 500 meters and offshore 1,000 meters or to laser extinction. Native imagery data is not generally in a format accessible to most Geographical Information Systems (GIS). Specialized in-house and commercial software packages processes the imagery data into GIS-compatible products for visualization and further analysis. Horizontal positions, provided in decimal degrees of latitude and longitude, are referenced to the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). Vertical positions are referenced to the NAD83 ellipsoid and provided in meters. The National Geodetic Survey's (NGS) GEOID03 model is used to transform the vertical positions from ellipsoid to orthometric heights referenced to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88). The SHOALS 532 laser has also been radiometrically calibrated to be able to determine the same reflectance for an object on any given day or operating altitude. The seafloor reflectance is generated from individual bathymetric waveforms, rasterized, and then a mosaic is produced for each flight. The accuracy is within 5% of the true reflectance. The data file naming convention is based on the year, project, area name, "Box" number, and product type. An example file name is "2007_NCMP_NY_Ontario_Laser_Reflectance_070615_1206.tif," where 2007 is the year of data collection, NCMP is the project under which data were collected, NY_Ontario is the area of data collection, "Laser_Reflectance" is the product type, and 070615_1206 is the YYMMDD_HHMM for the start time of the flight.Offline User Manual 22909 documentation Search Offline User Manual 22909 documentationThe NOAA Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) produces national standardized land cover and change products for the coastal regions of the U.S. C-CAP products inventory coastal intertidal areas, wetlands, and adjacent uplands with the goal of monitoring changes in these habitats, on a one-to-five year repeat cycle. The timeframe for this metadata is reported as 2006-Era, but the actual dates of the Landsat imagery used to create the land cover may have been acquired a few years before or after each era. These maps are developed utilizing Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery, and can be used to track changes in the landscape through time. This trend information gives important feedback to managers on the success or failure of management policies and programs and aid in developing a scientific understanding of the Earth system and its response to natural and human-induced changes. This understanding allows for the prediction of impacts due to these changes and the assessment of their cumulative effects, helping coastal resource managers make more informed regional decisions. NOAA C-CAP is a contributing member to the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics consortium and C-CAP products are included as the coastal expression of land cover within the National Land Cover Database.This image represents an 8 meter resolution backscatter mosaic of a seamount/bank east of Fajardo, Puerto Rico. NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Team, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory, federal, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data in and around the Northeast Reserve from 3/05/2013 to 3/29/2013. Data was acquired with a hull mounted Kongsberg EM1002 multibeam echosounder (95 kHz) and processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS software, applying all relevant correctors (attitude, sound velocity, absorption coefficient). Data is in UTM zone 20 north, datum NAD83. The backscatter component of the bathymetry data were geometrically and radiometrically corrected in CARIS HIPS Mosaic Editor. Acoustic backscatter mosaics are an important piece of information when characterizing surficial seafloor features and delineating benthic habitats. The project was conducted to meet IHO Order 1 and 2 accuracy standards, dependant on the project area and depth. All users should individually evaluate the suitability of this data according to their own needs and standards.The Cetacean Density and Distribution Mapping Working Group identified Biologically Important Areas (BIAs) for 24 cetacean species, stocks, or populations in seven regions (US East Coast, Gulf of Mexico, West Coast, Hawaiian Islands, Gulf of Alaska, Aleutian Islands and Bering Sea, and Arctic [encompassing the northeastern Chukchi and western Beaufort seas]) within US waters. BIAs are reproductive areas, feeding areas, migratory corridors, and areas in which small and resident populations are concentrated. BIAs are region-, species-, and time-specific. Information provided for each BIA includes the following: 1) a written narrative describing the information, assumptions, and logic used to delineate the BIA; 2) a map of the BIA; 3) a list of references used in the assessment; and 4) a metadata table that concisely details the type and quantity of information used to define a BIA, providing transparency in how BIAs were designated in a quick reference table format. BIAs were identified through an expert elicitation process. The delineation of BIAs does not have direct or immediate regulatory consequences. Rather, the BIA assessment is intended to provide the best available science to help inform regulatory and management decisions under existing authorities about some, though not all, important cetacean areas in order to minimize the impacts of anthropogenic activities on cetaceans and to achieve conservation and protection goals. In addition, the BIAs and associated information may be used to identify information gaps and prioritize future research and modeling efforts to better understand cetaceans, their habitat, and ecosystems.Department of Economics - University of OxfordEnvironmental Sensitivity Index (ESI) data characterize the marine and coastal environments and wildlife based on sensitivity to spilled oil. Coastal species that are listed as threatened, endangered, or as a species of concern, by either federal or state governments, are a primary focus. A subset of the ESI data, the ESI Threatened and Endangered Species (T) databases focus strictly on these species. Species are mapped individually. In addition to showing spatial extent, each species polygon, point, or line has attributes describing abundance, seasonality, threatened/endangered status, and life history. Both the state and federal status is provided, along with the year the ESI data were published. This is important, as the status of a species can vary over time. As always, the ESI data are a snapshot in time. The biology layers focus on threatened/endangered status, areas of high concentration, and areas where sensitive life stages may occur. Supporting data tables provide species-/location-specific abundance, seasonality, status, life history, and source information. Human-use resources mapped include managed areas (parks, refuges, critical habitats, etc.) and resources that may be impacted by oiling and/or cleanup, such as beaches, archaeological sites, marinas, etc. ESIs are available for the majority of the US coastline, as well as the US territories.

The Doldrums product was initially implemented on October 1, 2006 and continues to provide updated monitoring information daily. The latest version, Version 0.3, was implemented on November 24, 2008. This metadata file provides information on the product for the most recent near-real-time updates and the archived and retrospectively-produced product dating back to June 1, 2004. The current version of the product is derived from the experimental 6-hourly near-real-time NOAA/NESDIS National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) blended satellite sea surface winds product. Wind speeds used for deriving the CRW Doldrums product were generated by blending observations from multiple satellites. The blended product offers, globally, 0.25 degree x 0.25 degree ocean surface (10-meter height) winds interpolated from observations from up to six satellites. The blending of multiple satellite observations allows for greatly enhanced temporal resolution (up to 6-hourly). The satellites that have contributed to the Doldrums product include Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) sensors flown on-board the United States Air Force Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) F13, F14, and F15 satellites; the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission's (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI) on-board the TRMM satellite; SeaWinds scatterometer on-board the Quick Scatterometer (QuikSCAT) satellite; and the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) sensor on NASA's Aqua satellite. CRW uses wind speed data from these satellites to identify regions of low wind conditions, defined here as exhibiting a daily mean of less than 3 meters per second (i.e. "doldrums"). The duration of doldrums events is then tracked by accumulating the number of days over which this condition is met (doldrums days). As an experimental product, CRW's Sea Surface Wind Doldrums product undergoes continual development and refinement to determine the best configuration for the algorithm and to test its utility against past bleaching events. While basin-scale coral bleaching occurs as a result of large-scale climate phenomena, local weather patterns greatly influence bleaching variability among sites within a basin. Three related factors that influence local bleaching patterns are temperature, light, and mixing. One parameter that exerts a common influence over all of these is wind. As wind speed falls, there is reduced vertical mixing, evaporative cooling, and sensible heat transfer, increasing the likelihood of adverse temperature excursions during summertime maximum water temperatures (Mumby et al. 2001, Dunne and Brown 2001, Skirving and Guinotte 2001, Obura 2005). In addition, pronounced stratification that can result under low-wind conditions can enhance photo-degradation of colored dissolved organic material, thereby reducing shading over corals and enhancing the likelihood of bleaching (Manzello et al., 2006). Related details, as well as other important information, are provided in each HDF data file. The Sea Surface Wind Doldrums product is available in various formats, including static image, HDF data, and Google Earth.

NOAA Climate Normals are a large suite of data products that provide users with many tools to understand typical climate conditions for thousands of locations across the United States. As many NWS stations as possible are used, including those from the NWS Cooperative Observer Program (COOP) Network as well as some additional stations that have a Weather Bureau Army-Navy (WBAN) station identification number, including stations from the Climate Reference Network (CRN). The comprehensive U.S. Climate Normals dataset includes various derived products including daily air temperature normals (including maximum and minimum temperature normal, heating and cooling degree day normal, and others), precipitation normals (including snowfall and snow depth, percentiles, frequencies and other), and hourly normals (all normal derived from hourly data including temperature, dew point, heat index, wind chill, wind, cloudiness, heating and cooling degree hours, pressure normals). In addition to the standard set of normals, users also can find "agricultural normals", which are used in many industries, including but not limited to construction, architecture, pest control, etc. These supplemental "agricultural normals" include frost-freeze date probabilities, growing degree day normals, probabilities of reaching minimum temperature thresholds, and growing season length normals. Users can access the data either by product or by station. Included in the dataset is extensive documentation to describe station metadata, filename descriptions, and methodology of producing the data. All data utilized in the computation of the 1981-2010 Climate Normals were taken from the ISD Lite (a subset of derived Integrated Surface Data), the Global Historical Climatology Network-Daily dataset, and standardized monthly temperature data (COOP). These source datasets (including intermediate datasets used in the computation of products) are also archived at the NOAA NCDC.This is a fishery-independent survey that collects data on reef fish in southeast US waters using multiple gears, including chevron traps, video cameras, ROVs, longlines, and acoustics.

Accidentally lost or intentionally abandoned DFG circulates within the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre until it encounters the atolls of the NWHI. When the floating DFG reaches these islets and atolls, wave energy forces it across coral reefs, snagging the assorted nets and lines upon corals. DFG may impact coral reef ecosystems in a number of other ways, including destroying coral reef habitat, acting as a vector for the introduction of non-native species, and presenting a hazard to boat navigation. Most notably, entanglement in DFG presents a lethal threat to the critically endangered Hawaiian monk seal (Monachus schauinslandi) and the threatened green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas). Supported by the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument, NOAA's Marine Debris Program (MDP), NOAA's Damage Assessment Remediation and Restoration Program (DARRP), and NOAA's Coral Reef Conservation Program (CRCP), the marine debris team of the Coral Reef Ecosystem Division (CRED) at the Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC) conducts cruises to the NWHI for the purpose of surveying and removing DFG. Exploratory and opportunistic efforts began in 1996 that eventually evolved into dedicated cruises deployed for up to 4 months at a time with a team of up to 16 divers. To date, CRED's marine debris team has removed approximately 769 metric tons of derelict fishing gear from the NWHI, including the atolls and islets of Pearl and Hermes Atoll (PHR), Midway Atoll (MID), Kure Atoll (KUR), Lisianski Island (LIS), Laysan Island (LAY), Maro Reef (MAR), and French Frigate Shoals (FFS). Surveys are conducted by divers based on small boats launched from a ship. Two survey methods are used to search for marine debris; tow survey and swim survey. Tow surveys are used in the relatively even-depth (usually less than 10 meters deep), contiguous backreef habitats, while swim surveys are used in the comparatively high-relief and patchy lagoonal reef habitats. Survey areas are chosen based on regional reef morphology and past accumulation records. In a tow survey, two freediving divers are towed behind a small boat at an average of 1-2 knots. Each diver has a board with which they maneuver through the water column in a vertical and horizontal serpentine pattern. The small-boat coxswain drives the boat in parallel tracks to cover the planned survey area. Tow tracks are recorded on a GPS unit that is set to record at 15 second intervals. Tow track survey lines are downloaded and converted to polygon features in ArcGIS using a 15 meter buffer (7.5 meters on each side) to represent area surveyed by the towed divers. The swim survey method, first used for NWHI marine debris detection in 2002, was developed as a necessary alternative to towed-diver surveys in lagoonal, reticulated reef areas that were either too shallow or too irregular to be surveyed effectively with the tow survey technique. The divers are directed by personnel in small boats to follow pre-planned routes. When a distinguishable reef has been surveyed, the small-boat coxswain drives a GPS-recorded track around that particular reef. These areas are digitized into polygon features in ArcGIS using a combination of the recorded tracks and IKONOS satellite imagery in which reef edges are visible in 4 meter resolution. When a diver encounters a piece of DFG during either type of survey, the diver notifies the coxswain to stop the boat and take a waypoint over the DFG. Descriptive data about the piece of DFG such as DFG type, DFG color, estimated depth, length/width/height (layout of DFG in the water as found by divers), foul level, presence/absence of coral growth on DFG (including growth type and coral genera), substrate composition/color and volume are recorded and maintained in an Oracle database. Waypoints are recorded for locations of DFG and are downloaded as shapefiles with attributes that include waypoint name, UTC date and time collected, Hawaii standard time collected, small boat label, GPS unit label, survey type (swim or tow), survey zone (high entanglement risk zone or standard), source (water or land) and an Item designation. Waypoint data for DFG is maintained in an Oracle database table that is linked to descriptive data about each point of DFG via a common waypoint name, date, and GPS unit label. In 2011, opportunistic land debris survey and removal efforts were conducted on all three of the Midway Islands; Sand Island, Eastern Island and Spit Island. In 2012 and 2013 the addition of planned land debris survey and removal efforts in all surveyable shoreline areas of all three of the Midway Islands; Sand Island, Eastern Island and Spit Island were conducted. During land debris efforts, shorelines were surveyed and all derelict fishing gear and plastic items larger than 10 cm were removed (with the exception of plastic bottle caps and lighters). The NOAA MDP-standardized shoreline survey datasheet was used to tally different debris types during the removal process. Additionally, one 100-m transect was established on each of the three islands in order to conduct the NOAA MDP Standing Stock survey for marine debris. Cruises target one or more of the atolls of the NWHI and vary in duration from one to four months. The following table displays the names of vessels that participated in research cruises each year and the atolls they visited, as well as the land-based efforts not associated with vessels.

These data sets are available online from each of the partner countries both for visualization and download. The North American Atlas data are standardized geospatial data sets at 1:10,000,000 scale. A variety of basic data layers (e.g. roads, railroads, populated places, political boundaries, hydrography, bathymetry, sea ice and glaciers) have been integrated so that their relative positions are correct. This collection of data sets forms a base with which other North American thematic data may be integrated. Any data outside of Canada, Mexico, and the United States of America included in the North American Atlas data sets is strictly to complete the context of the data. The North American Atlas - Populated Places data set shows a selection of named populated places suitable for use at a scale of 1:10,000,000. Places, which refer to individual municipalities, are always shown using point symbols. These symbols have been fitted to the North American Atlas roads, railroads, and hydrography layers, so that the points represent the approximate locations of places relative to data in these other layers. The selection of populated places was based on local importance (as shown by population size), importance as a cross-border point, and, occasionally, on other factors. All capital cities (national, provincial, territorial or State) are shown for Canada, Mexico, and the United States of America. Attributes were added to the data to reflect population class, name, and capital. Cartographic considerations were taken into account so that names do not overlap in crowded areas, nor are there too many names shown for sparsely-populated areas.WMSThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

This shapefile represents the first attempt to assign reasonable NEHRP soil classifications to the geologic materials throughout Indiana. The NEHRP soil classifications are based on geologic and engineering response to earthquake-induced ground shaking. NEHRP links the physical properties of soils, such as shear strength and effect on shear-wave velocity propagation, to ensure a uniform classification for nonlithified materials in the context of their performance when subjected to seismically induced ground shaking. Ranked A through F, the correct NEHRP soil class is best determined from the average shear-wave velocity of the soil column. Attributes include the following NEHRP soil classes (Hill and Foshee, 2008, Table 1, p. 5): A - Hard rock; average shear-wave velocity greater than 1,500 meters per second; amplification factor equal to 0.08. Note that Class A is not present in Indiana. B - Rock; average shear-wave velocity 760 to 1,500 meters per second; amplification factor equal to 1.0. C - Hard and (or) stiff to very stiff soils, including most gravel; average shear-wave velocity 360 to 760 meters per second; amplification factor equal to 1.1 to 1.2. D - Sands, silts, and (or) stiff to very stiff clays, and some gravel; average shear-wave velocity 180 to 360 meters per second; amplification factor equal to 1.2 to 1.6. E - Small to moderate thickness (10 to 50 feet), soft to medium-stiff clay, plasticity index greater than 20, moisture greater than 40 percent; average shear-wave velocity is less than 180 meters per second; amplification factor equal to 1.2 to 2.5. F - Soils vulnerable to potential failure or collapse under seismic loading, including liquifiable soils, quick and sensitive clays, and collapsible, weakly cemented soils; average shear-wave velocity is not applicable; amplification factor is not applicable. The following is excerpted from Indiana Geological Survey Report of Progress 35: "The distribution and classification of soil types are essential to understanding the response of geologic materials to ground shaking induced by earthquakes. Thirty-seven shear-wave velocities were measured in soft sediments at various localities throughout Indiana, twenty-eight sites of which were measured using downhole methods in freshly augered and cased wells. Purdue University provided eight additional shear-wave profiles from eight sites in their Agricultural Centers; also included is a profile from one other site in Vanderburgh County. These data, coupled with the thickness of the unconsolidated materials, were used to determine the potential amplification of earthquake-induced ground shaking. This report begins the process of defining the response of geologic materials to ground shaking induced by an earthquake having an epicenter within Indiana or nearby states. It is intended to be a tool to enhance the performance of the computer program HAZUS, developed by the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency to model the effects of earthquakes and to assess damage scenarios. "Plate 1 of this report, a map of Indiana at a scale of 1:500,000 showing the predicted response of geologic materials to seismically induced ground shaking, is intended only for regional planning purposes and is not a substitute for on-site shear-wave measurements and geotechnical data. Continued field work is anticipated, the results of which will enhance the accuracy and value of the map."Integrated Surface Hourly (ISH) Data is digital data set DSI-3505, archived at the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC).

The US Air Force Combat Climatology Center (AFCCC), the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC), and the US Navy's Fleet Numerical Meteorological and Oceanographical Command Detachment (FNMOD), make up the FCC in Asheville. Each agency is responsible for data ingest, quality control, and customer support for surface climatological data. All data are now stored in a single ASCII format. Numerous DOD and civilian customers use this database in climatological applications. ISH refers to the digital database and format in which hourly and synoptic (3-hourly) weather observations are stored. The format conforms to Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS). The database includes data originating from various codes such as synoptic, airways, METAR (Meteorological Routine Weather Report), and SMARS (Supplementary Marine Reporting Station), as well as observations from automatic weather stations. The data are sorted by station-year-month-day-hour-minute. Parameters included are: Air Quality, Atmospheric Pressure, Atmospheric Temperature, Atmospheric Winds, Clouds, Precipitation, Ocean Waves, and Tides. ISD Version 1 was released in 2001, with Version 2 (additional quality control applied) in 2003. Since 2003, there have been continued incremental improvements in automated quality control software.This data set consists of the polygonal boundaries for the 2000 Census Tracts for Arizona. Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county delineated by local participants as part of the U.S. Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program. The U.S. Census Bureau delineated census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where local or tribal governments declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of decennial census data. Census tracts generally have between 1,500 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. (Counties with fewer people have a single census tract.) When first delineated, census tracts are designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Census tract boundaries are delineated with the intention of being maintained over many decades so that statistical comparisons can be made from decennial census to decennial census. However, physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new developments, and so forth, may require occasional boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth or combined as a result of substantial population decline. Census tracts are identified by a four-digit basic number and may have a two-digit numeric suffix; for example, 6059.02. The decimal point separating the four-digit basic tract number from the two-digit suffix is shown in the printed reports and on census maps. In computer-readable files, the decimal point is implied.The AgSat Areas of Interest map contains area polygons where satellite imagery will be collected for the Farm Service Agency (FSA) to provide imagery coverage for FSA business to include image base replacement, torando damage assessment, and drought assessment.

Puget Sound Chinook are accumulating polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), contaminants of emerging concern. However, information on tissue concentrations of PBDEs associated with adverse effects in salmon and other fish is limited. These data are critical for assessing the risk associated with current and future levels of PBDEs in threatened salmon stocks. We propose to expose salmon to levels of PBDE congeners found previously in Puget Sound Chinook, as well as encompass levels of uncertainties associated with model predictions and potential climate change. The output of this project will significantly contribute to increasing the scientific understanding of the impacts of PBDE exposure by developing dose-response data of disease susceptibility, and endocrine and immune function. An outcome of this study is the protection of Puget Sounds food web and waters by developing protective standards for aquatic life and reducing toxins. Results of chemical analyses of PBDEs in salmon; concentrations of PBDE congeners in tissues of juvenile salmonFive possible storms in the Atlantic - Caribbean BasinIf you live near one of the seismic zones in the central United States, this handbook explains why you should be concerned with earthquakes, what you can expect during a quake, and what you need to do beforehand to be safe and reduce property damage.Global Surface Summary of the Day is derived from The Integrated Surface Hourly (ISH) dataset. The ISH dataset includes global data obtained from the USAF Climatology Center, located in the Federal Climate Complex with NCDC. The latest daily summary data are normally available 1-2 days after the date-time of the observations used in the daily summaries. The online data files begin with 1929 and are at the time of this writing at the Version 8 software level. Over 9000 stations' data are typically available. The daily elements included in the dataset (as available from each station) are: Mean temperature (.1 Fahrenheit) Mean dew point (.1 Fahrenheit) Mean sea level pressure (.1 mb) Mean station pressure (.1 mb) Mean visibility (.1 miles) Mean wind speed (.1 knots) Maximum sustained wind speed (.1 knots) Maximum wind gust (.1 knots) Maximum temperature (.1 Fahrenheit) Minimum temperature (.1 Fahrenheit) Precipitation amount (.01 inches) Snow depth (.1 inches) Indicator for occurrence of: Fog, Rain or Drizzle, Snow or Ice Pellets, Hail, Thunder, Tornado/Funnel Cloud Global summary of day data for 18 surface meteorological elements are derived from the synoptic/hourly observations contained in USAF DATSAV3 Surface data and Federal Climate Complex Integrated Surface Hourly (ISH). Historical data are generally available for 1929 to the present, with data from 1973 to the present being the most complete. For some periods, one or more countries' data may not be available due to data restrictions or communications problems. In deriving the summary of day data, a minimum of 4 observations for the day must be present (allows for stations which report 4 synoptic observations/day). Since the data are converted to constant units (e.g, knots), slight rounding error from the originally reported values may occur (e.g, 9.9 instead of 10.0). The mean daily values described below are based on the hours of operation for the station. For some stations/countries, the visibility will sometimes 'cluster' around a value (such as 10 miles) due to the practice of not reporting visibilities greater than certain distances. The daily extremes and totals--maximum wind gust, precipitation amount, and snow depth--will only appear if the station reports the data sufficiently to provide a valid value. Therefore, these three elements will appear less frequently than other values. Also, these elements are derived from the stations' reports during the day, and may comprise a 24-hour period which includes a portion of the previous day. The data are reported and summarized based on Greenwich Mean Time (GMT, 0000Z - 2359Z) since the original synoptic/hourly data are reported and based on GMT.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

This grid has been produced as part of the "Bathymetric Atlas of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands -- A Planning Document for Benthic Habitat Mapping -- Draft -- May 2003. Data sources for the downloadable grids include: multibeam bathymetry from Simrad EM1002 and EM120 sonars aboard the R/V Kilo Moana collected in October/November 2003; multibeam bathymetry data from a SeaBeam 210 sonar aboard the R/V Kai'imikai-O-Kanaloa collected in 2000-2002; LIDAR data obtained using the LADS MK II lidar system; and depth data derived from IKONOS satellite imagery. No tidal corrections have been applied to the data. The data source location for each type of data is indicated in the "dot plot" browse objects. Additional single-beam bathymetric data are available in this area and are indicated on the 100-001b Plot C browse object, but these less accurate depths are not included in the downloadable grid. Multibeam data were processed using SABER editing software and MBSystem and multibeam, LIDAR and IKONOS data were integrated using MBSystem, and GMT. Grid spacing is 60-m, horizontal accuracy is 20m (no differential GPS correctors applied), vertical accuracy is depth dependent (~1% of water depth), WGS84 datum. These data are not to be used for navigation.The Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS) is a weather forecast model made up of 21 separate forecasts, or ensemble members. The National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) started the GEFS to address the nature of uncertainty in weather observations, which are used to initialize weather forecast models. The proverbial butterfly flapping her wings can have a cascading effect leading to wind gusts thousands of miles away. This extreme example illustrates that tiny, unnoticeable differences between reality and what is actually measured can, over time, lead to noticeable differences between what a weather model forecast predicts and reality itself. The GEFS attempts to quantify the amount of uncertainty in a forecast by generating an ensemble of multiple forecasts, each minutely different, or perturbed, from the original observations. With global coverage, GEFS is produced four times a day with weather forecasts going out to 16 days and a 6 hour temporal resolution. This dataset has 2.5 degree horizontal resolution.WMSThese GIS files represent geographic boundaries for lands that are under the protection of NYS Agricultural District Law, administered by the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets.

Chum salmon spawners returning to Fish Creek, southeastern Alaska, were sampled yearly from 1972 through 1996. Spawners retuning to the Quilcene National Fish Hatchery in Hood Canal, Washington, were sampled yearly from 1973 through 1996. Size at maturity of both populations declined significantly from about 1980 to the mid-1990s. Age at maturity increased during this time. These changes were associated with a major ocean climate regime shift in the North Pacific Ocean that occurred in 1976-77. Population abundance of chum salmon increased greatly after the regime shift, especially in Asia. Similar changes in size and age at maturity occurred in Asian chum salmon; because the range of North American and Asian chum salmon overlaps on the high seas, these changes are discussed in relation to possible density-dependent population factors. Since the mid-1990s, size at maturity and population abundance have increased, possibly indicating another climate change in the North Pacific Ocean.A population of bottlenose dolphins forms a primary interest of Cardigan Bay and it was for this that Cardigan Bay was first selected as a Special Area of Conservation. Cardigan Bay is known to host the largest population of semi-resident bottlenose dolphins in the UK. The data collected as part of this research is being used to monitor the population dynamics and beahaviour of bottlenose dolphins and harbour porpoises in Cardigan Bay. Cardigan Bay is known to host the largest population of semi-resident bottlenose dolphins in the UK. This data covers monitoring carried out by the Sea Watch Foundation between 2011-2013 on behalf of the Countryside Council for Wales and subsequently Natural Resources Wales, to monitor bottlenose dolphin and harbour porpoise populations in Cardigan Bay. As of April 1st 2012, all of the Countryside Council for Wales (CCW) data is held and managed by Natural Resources Wales (NRW).Visual transect surveys were performed and hogfish (Lachnolaimus maximus) were harvested over a range of depths and habitat types within the central eastern Gulf of Mexico. Hogfish were recorded as present during 73% of all performed dives, and were most common over rugose natural hard bottom habitat. As depth and distance from shore increased, hogfish density decreased; however, mean hogfish size and age showed a positive relationship with depth. A dramatic difference emerged between shallow and deep water collections, with fish transitioning into males at a much smaller size and age within shallow water. Furthermore, fish older than 8 yrs and larger than 559 mm FL were not recorded from shallow water sites, while deep water collections yielded fish as old as 19 and as large as 765 mm FL. Observed sex ratio had a mean value of 1:10 M: F, and showed no change with season or site depth, suggesting that hogfish maintain harem structure throughout the year. Gonad histology and visual observations of courtship behavior support previous accounts that hogfish spawn in the winter and spring, with highest reproductive activity recorded during March and April. Evidence is presented for a more protracted spawning period at greater depths. Growth parameters as well as survival and mortality estimates are similar to those estimated previously for hogfish within the eastern Gulf of Mexico.Links to current Geographic Analysis and Monitoring (GAM)studies.USGS water resources home page for Hawaii, Micronesia, and American Samoa with links to detailed hydrologic studies and real-time and long term data on streamflow, ground and surface water, water quality, rainfall, water use and current issues.WMSUSCRN Hourly Products are available on public FTP and derived from the USCRN processed data.

Acquisition Description: Fungia scutariasample collection Adult specimens of the solitary coralF. scutariawere collected from Kaneohe Bay on the northeastern shore of Oahu, Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean in June 2010 and kept in open-system tanks (sea tables) at the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology in anticipation of spawning events. Following spawning, eggs and sperm were collected for fertilization in Petri dishes, and replicate batches of larvae were raised in 0.1 m-filtered (sterile), 1.6 m-filtered (excludesSymbiodiniumand zooplankton), 20 m-filtered (excludes zooplankton) or raw seawater. Samples from each life history stage (eggs, larvae, juveniles, and adults) were frozen for DNA analysis in DNA lysis buffer. Eggs and embryos were rinsed in sterilized seawater upon sampling. Each adult sample consists of three small pieces of an individual coral combined in one tube. Ca. 1 L of seawater was sampled from the sea tables one hour prior to the final spawning event, filtered, and frozen for DNA analysis in DNA lysis buffer. 50 mL of the culture water was sampled from the Petri dish treatments (originally 0.1 m-filtered, 1.6 m-filtered, or 20 m-filtered seawater) after approximately 72 hours of exposure to the developing coral larvae during the final experiment. Montipora capitatasample collection Fragments of adult specimens of the colonial coralM. capitatawere collected from Kaneohe Bay in June 2010 and July 2011 and kept in sea tables at HIMB in anticipation of spawning events. Following spawning, egg-sperm bundles were collected from the sea tables for fertilization in Petri dishes, and replicate batches of larvae were raised in 0.1 m-filtered, 1.6 m-filtered, or 20 m-filtered seawater. Samples from each life history stage (egg-sperm bundles, larvae, juveniles, and adults) were frozen for DNA analysis in DNA lysis buffer. Egg-sperm bundles were rinsed in TFF sterilized seawater upon sampling. Each adult sample consists of three small pieces of an individual coral combined in one tube. Ca. 1 L of seawater was sampled from the sea tables approximately one hour prior to the final spawning event, filtered, and frozen for DNA analysis in DNA lysis buffer. 35 mL of the culture water was sampled from the Petri dish treatments (originally 0.1 m-filtered, 1.6 m-filtered, or 20 m-filtered seawater) after approximately 72 hours of exposure to the developing coral larvae during the final experiment in 2010, filtered, and frozen for DNA analysis in DNA lysis buffer. Additionally, throughout summer 2010, field-spawned egg-sperm bundles and field-fertilized larvae were collected from Kaneohe Bay and raised under the same treatments (0.1 m-filtered, 1.6 m-filtered, 20 m-filtered, or raw seawater), and sampled in the same manner and at the same life-history stages (egg-sperm bundles, larvae, juveniles, and adults) as the corals spawned in sea tables. Ca. 1 L of seawater was sampled from the Kaneohe Bay lagoon 1 hour prior to the August 2010 field-spawning event and 1 hour after the June and July 2010 field-spawning events, filtered, and filters were frozen for DNA analysis in DNA lysis buffer. DNA extraction and Illumina amplicon sequencing of bacterial SSU rRNA genes Nucleic acids were extracted fromF. scutariacorals and filters using the NucleoSpin Soil Kit (Macherey-Nagel, Duren, Germany) following the manufacturer s protocol, modified as follows: lysis buffer SL1 and Enhancer SX were used, lysis time was increased to 20 min and two subsequent elution steps were performed with 50 l fresh elution buffer each. DNA quality and yield were checked by agarose gel electrophoresis. Nucleic acids were extracted fromM. capitatasamples and filters using the PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (MO BIO, Carlsbad, CA) following the manufacturer s protocol, modified as follows: initial physical disruption time (via vortex) was increased to 30 min, and two subsequent elution steps were performed with 100 l fresh DNA-Free PCR Grade water each. DNA quality and yield were checked by agarose gel electrophoresis. The V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified with the primer pair F515/R806, which include Illumina flowcell adapter sequences and a sample-specific barcode on the reverse primer. The MasterTaq Kit (5 PRIME, Hamburg, Germany) was used for all PCR reactions. Amplification was performed using a touchdown protocol as in as follows: initial denaturation at 95 C for 3 min, and 30 cycles at 95 C for 30 sec, 65 C for 1 min (decreasing by 0.5 C per cycle), and 72 C for 2 min. After these 30 cycles, a further 5 7 cycles were performed using an annealing temperature of 50 C, and concluding with a final extension at 72 C for 20 min. Resulting PCR amplicons were quantified using the PicoGreen dsDNA assay (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), pooled at equimolar concentrations and subsequently cleaned using the UltraClean PCR Clean-Up Kit (MO BIO Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA). Sequencing of theF. scutariaPCR products was performed on an Illumina MiSeq at the University of Colorado BioFrontiers Institute (Boulder, CO), while sequencing of theM. capitataPCR products was performed on an Illumina MiSeq at the University of Hawaii HIMB Genetics Core Facility (Kaneohe, HI).Discussion of large floods and occurrence in relationship to regional climatology, topography, and basin size.The primary goal of U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Natural Hazards Response is to ensure that the disaster response community has access to timely, accurate, and relevant geospatial products, imagery, and services during and after an emergency event.The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Undersea Research Center at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington (NURC/UNCW) coordinated an acoustic survey in portions of the Oculina Habitat Area of Particular Concern from June 14-19, 2005.

The MTDB provides seamless national coverage with no overlaps or gaps between parts. Each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or it can be combined with shapefiles for other counties to cover a region or the entire nation. The Address Ranges Feature Shapefile (ADDRFEAT.dbf) contains the geospatial edge geometry and attributes of all unsuppressed address ranges for a county or county equivalent area. The term "address range" refers to the collection of all possible structure numbers from the first structure number to the last structure number and all numbers of a specified parity in between along an edge side relative to the direction in which the edge is coded. Single-address address ranges have been suppressed to maintain the confidentiality of the addresses they describe. Multiple coincident address range feature edge records are represented in the shapefile if more than one left or right address ranges are associated to the edge. The ADDRFEAT shapefile contains a record for each address range to street name combination. Address range associated to more than one street name are also represented by multiple coincident address range feature edge records. Note that the ADDRFEAT shapefile includes all unsuppressed address ranges compared to the All Lines Shapefile (EDGES.shp) which only includes the most inclusive address range associated with each side of a street edge. The TIGER/Line Shapefiles contain potential address ranges, not individual addresses. The address ranges in the TIGER/Line Shapefiles are potential ranges that include the full range of possible structure numbers even though the actual structures may not exist.To support a long-term NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program (CRCP) for sustainable management and conservation of coral reef ecosystems, from 10-11, 14, 19 March 2010, belt transect surveys of coral population and diseases quantitative assessments were conducted, as a part of Rapid Ecological Assessments (REA), during the Pacific Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program (RAMP) Cruise HI1001 in American Samoa at biennial intervals by the Coral Reef Ecosystem Division (CRED) at the NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC). During the cruise, there were 11 surveys in total conducted at REA sites around Ofu and Olosega Island in American Samoa. At the specific REA sites, coral biologists along with algal biologists and marine invertebrate zoologist entered the water and conducted a fine-scale (~300 m2) and high degree of taxonomic resolution REA survey to assess and monitor species composition, abundance, percent cover, size distribution, diversity, and general health of corals, macro-invertebrates, and algae in shallow-water (< 35 m) habitats. As a part of REA surveys, the coral belt surveys were focused on quantifying the diversity, abundance, density, and size-class distribution of the anthozoan and hydrozoan corals as well as the condition and health state of the coral reef populations. The surveys were conducted along two consecutively-placed, 25m transect lines. The belt width was 1-m wide, 0.5-m on each side of the transect line. Within each 25m transect, five 2.5-meter segments were surveyed (beginning at points: 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 meters), whereby in each segment, all coral colonies whose center fell within 0.5m of either side of the transect line were identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible (genus or species) and two planar size metrics were collected: maximum diameter and diameter perpendicular to the maximum diameter. In addition, the extent of mortality, both recent and old, was estimated for each colony. Observers paid special attention to identifying as best as possible the extent of the former live colony. When a coral colony exhibited signs of disease or compromised health, additional information was recorded including type of affliction (bleaching, skeletal growth anomaly, white syndrome, tissue loss other than white syndrome, trematodiasis, necrosis, other, pigmentation responses, algal overgrowth, and predation), severity of the affliction (mild, moderate, marked, severe, acute), as well as photographic documentation and sometimes tissue samples. Tissue samples were catalogued and fixed in buffered zinc-formalin solution for further histopathological analyses. Raw survey data included species presence and relative abundance, colony counts per taxon, size (width and length), mortality, predation, and health status. A surveyed area was ranging from 10m2 to 25m2 per site.WFS Service for RGIS dataset American Indian/ Alaska Native Area/ Hawaiian Homeland Areas for Socorro County, New Mexico, 2006se TIGER (42761206-d684-4b60-858c-b8d05dc0d798)Mathematical models predict overall streamflow, runoff, subsurface flow, groundwater flow, and soil moisture in this area in response to four different greenhouse gas emission scenarios.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

The NOAA National Geophysical Data Center serves as the long-term archive of these data.TIGER, TIGER/Line, and Census TIGER are registered trademarks of the Bureau of the Census. The Redistricting Census 2000 TIGER/Line files are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the Census TIGER data base. The geographic coverage for a single TIGER/Line file is a county or statistical equivalent entity, with the coverage area based on January 1, 2000 legal boundaries. A complete set of Redistricting Census 2000 TIGER/Line files includes all counties and statistically equivalent entities in the United States and Puerto Rico. The Redistricting Census 2000 TIGER/Line files will not include files for the Island Areas. The Census TIGER data base represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts. However, each county-based TIGER/Line file is designed to stand alone as an independent data set or the files can be combined to cover the whole Nation. The Redistricting Census 2000 TIGER/Line files consist of line segments representing physical features and governmental and statistical boundaries. The Redistricting Census 2000 TIGER/Line files do NOT contain the ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) and the address ranges are of approximately the same vintage as those appearing in the 1999 TIGER/Line files. That is, the Census Bureau is producing the Redistricting Census 2000 TIGER/Line files in advance of the computer processing that will ensure that the address ranges in the TIGER/Line files agree with the final Master Address File (MAF) used for tabulating Census 2000. The files contain information distributed over a series of record types for the spatial objects of a county. There are 17 record types, including the basic data record, the shape coordinate points, and geographic codes that can be used with appropriate software to prepare maps. Other geographic information contained in the files includes attributes such as feature identifiers/census feature class codes (CFCC) used to differentiate feature types, address ranges and ZIP Codes, codes for legal and statistical entities, latitude/longitude coordinates of linear and point features, landmark point features, area landmarks, key geographic features, and area boundaries. The Redistricting Census 2000 TIGER/Line data dictionary contains a complete list of all the fields in the 17 record types.Line point intercept (LPI) surveys and benthic composition assessments were conducted during Rapid Ecological Assessments (REA) as part of the Pacific Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program (RAMP) cruise HA1008 in Main Hawaiian Islands from 20101007 to 20101105. Surveys are conducted by the Coral Reef Ecosystem Division (CRED) of the NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC) at biennial intervals to support a long-term NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program (CRCP) for sustainable management and conservation of coral reef ecosystems. During the cruise, 15 REA sites were surveyed at Maui in Main Hawaiian Islands. Benthic biologists from NOAA's Coral Reef Ecosystem Division conducted Line Point Intercept surveys to quantitatively document the benthic cover at pre-determined long-term monitoring REA sites. Two linear 25 m transects were surveyed with a 5 m inter-transect region between the end of Transect 1 and the start of Transect 2. The LPI diver determines the benthic composition at 20 cm intervals for a total of 125 data points per transect. All living benthic elements (e.g., coral, algae, and other invertebrates) were identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible, often substituting functional group categories for turf algae and crustose coralline algae when identification in the field was extremely difficult. In cases where the substrate is bare or covered with turf algae, the substrate composition is also noted as either sand, rock, rubble, carbonate pavement, or dead coral. The data allows for the assessment and monitoring of species composition and abundance and provide the basis for computing quantitative estimates of percent cover at higher taxonomic levels like functional group (live coral, macroalgae, turf algae) or on a finer taxonomic resolution such as genus level.Label (point) feature class of Office Of Emergency Management (OEM) Ambulatory Surgical Centers throughout Miami-Dade County.Search TIAA-CREF CommunitiesWMSFact sheet on the need to protect biological soil crusts in the desert.

The NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service Mississippi Laboratories at Pascagoula and Stennis Space Center and the NOAA National Coastal Data Development Center (NCDDC) at Stennis Space Center began the Hypoxia Watch project in 2001. Scientists aboard the NOAA Research Vessel Oregon II measure seawater properties, such as water temperature, salinity, chlorophyll, and dissolved oxygen at each of approximately 240 locations as the Oregon II cruises the waters south of Pascagoula, MS and then makes its way from Brownsville, Texas, to the mouth of the Mississippi River. A scientist aboard the ship processes the measurements from electronic dissolved oxygen sensors, checks the measurements periodically with chemical analyses of the seawater, then sends the data by e-mail to NCDDC at Stennis Space Center approximately every three to five days. Physical Scientists at NCDDC transform the dissolved oxygen measurements into contour maps, which identify areas of low oxygen, or hypoxia. During the 6-week cruise, as the data is received from the ship, NCDDC generates new maps and immediately publishes them on the web. The first map will usually cover an area off the Mississippi coast, successive maps will add areas of the continental shelf from Brownsville to Galveston, and the final map will usually cover the entire Texas-Louisiana-Mississippi coast. Maps are published every three to five days from approximately June 10 to July 20.Information on porphyry copper deposits from around the world with grade and tonnage models, a general classification based on geologic setting, mineralogy, with data allowing locations of these deposits to be plotted using GIS.Report: Arnold, SE. 1971.

The study known as the CREEK Project began in January 1996. Based on preliminary geomorphological observations of North Inlet creeks, by fall of 1996, eight creeks similar in size and configuration were selected for the study. Geomorphological observations were made in four stages ranging from general to detailed: 1) a general reconnaissance and the selection of the eight creeks, 2) Chris Corbett and Leroy Humphries conducted detailed survey of the internal geomorphology of the selected eight creeks using GIS equipment, 3) Leah Gregory produced a oyster reef map and oyster biomass determination (referred to as the Oyster Biomass Database), and 4) Dennis Allen measured and classified all creek bottoms (referred to as Internal Creek Habitat Survey). The first three stages occurred before the first nekton measurement, which was in March 1997. In January 1997, oysters were added or removed from each creek to equalize oyster biomass at 8 grams dry body weight per cubic meter of bank full water volume in each creek. This stage of the project is referred to as the "pre-manipulation" period where all creeks have the same amount of oyster biomass. In February 1998, about one year after the first set of water quality, chemistry, nekton and other measurements were made, living oysters were removed from four of the eight creeks (creeks 1, 4, 5, and 8), resulting in zero dry body weight per cubic meter of water at bank full volume. This was done to investigate the role of oyster reefs in controlling levels of dissolved and particulate materials in the water and to evaluate relationships between living oysters and nekton in the creeks. During the year following oyster removal, all measurements made in the first year were repeated. The second year of the project during which four of the creeks were without oyster biomass was known as the "manipulation" stage. The BACI analysis was used to compare data between the two years. Nekton samples were taken in March, June, August, and in November of 1997 and 1998, always following the same procedures. To sample the nekton present in creeks, a block net was set up at the mouth of each creek starting at a daybreak slack high tide on which the flooding level did not exceed the tops of the marsh banks (=bank full). At low tide, animals in block nets were collected and frozen. Because each creek contained tidal pools, seines were used to obtain nekton from areas retaining water and nekton at low tide. Each pool sample was also frozen. At the time of sampling, additional data such as water temperature, salinity, tidal height and time were recorded. In the months following, block net and pool samples were thawed and animals were sorted and identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level (defined as 'species' in the following description). Length data [Standard Length (SL) in mm] were obtained for up to 100 individuals in each taxonomic category. Biomass data were obtained first for the 100 individuals, and then for the entire species sample (total weight for each species). Species abundance was extrapolated from the total weight when more than 100 individuals were collected. This procedure was followed for each species in the sample. For block nets, samples were thawed and split to a manageable volume following the preceding guidelines. Total species biomass and abundance were extrapolated from subsample data. Abundance and biomass calculations per cubic meter were determined using the volume estimates for each creek. See the CREEK Project's Tidal Creek Geomorphology Metadata (Corbett/Humphries GIS Survey) for more information about how the volume estimates for each creek were made.This data set contains imagery from the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP). The NAIP acquires digital ortho imagery during the agricultural growing seasons in the continental U.S.. A primary goal of the NAIP program is to enable availability of ortho imagery within one year of acquisition. The NAIP provides two main products: 1 meter ground sample distance (GSD) ortho imagery rectified to a horizontal accuracy within +/- 5 meters of reference digital ortho quarter quads (DOQQ's) from the National Digital Ortho Program (NDOP) or from the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP); 1 meter GSD ortho imagery rectified within +/- 6 meters to true ground. The tiling format of NAIP imagery is based on a 3.75' x 3.75' quarter quadrangle with a 300 meter buffer on all four sides. The NAIP imagery is formatted to the UTM coordinate system using the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). The NAIP imagery may contain as much as 10% cloud cover per tile. The quarter quads have been reprojected from UTM 11 or UTM 12 to IDTM83 projection (ESPG 102605), mosaicked into 100k tiles, and compressed using ERDAS Imagine for use in ArcGIS.These data inform the public of all stocks and stock complexes that have been subject to overfishing since 2000. If stocks are no longer subject to overfishing, the year the stock was taken off the overfishing listed is indicated. The data excludes stocks that were later determined should not have been on the overfishing list (i.e. individual stocks were listed instead of correctly listing a single stock complex, listing was in error).The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

The cores were collected vertically down the axis of maximum growth of the colony. Cores were subsampled into 1mm growth increments, resulting in an average of 12 samples/annual growth increment. These samples were analysed for d18O, then the data interpolated to seasonal resolution (presented here). In this region, seasonal and interannual variations in skeletal d18O are due to the combined effects of changes in precipitation/evaporation balance and temperature; see Tudhope et al., 1995, Earth Planet.

Juvenile salmon were exposed to different malathion concentrations for 96 hours at low (11C) and high (19-20C) temperatures. Lethal concentration curves were generated from the counts of acute mortalities and survivors. Malathion was significantly more acutely toxic to Chinook salmon when exposure occurred at a higher temperature; LC50 decreased from 364 g/l at 11C to 274 g/l at 19-20C. The effect of exposure to a sub-lethal malathion concentration (LC2), at low and high temperatures, on the immune system of Chinook salmon was assessed with a disease susceptibility assay. Malathion exposure at the low temperature had no observable effect on disease susceptibility. However, salmon exposed to malathion at high temperatures had an 11% increase in disease susceptibility relative to salmon exposed to malathion at low temperatures; temperature alone accounted for a 7% increase in disease susceptibility. Effect of malathion on juvenile salmon healthThe mosaic image contained in this file is comprised of multiple RGB images that were collected by the Compact Hydrographic Airborne Rapid Total Survey (CHARTS) system along the coast of Illinois. CHARTS integrates topographic and bathymetric lidar sensors, a digital camera, and a hyperspectral scanner on a single remote sensing platform for use in coastal mapping and charting activities. Data coverage generally extends along the coastline from the waterline inland 500 meters and offshore 1,000 meters or to laser extinction. Native imagery data is not generally in a format accessible to most Geographical Information Systems (GIS). Specialized in-house and commercial software packages processes the imagery data into GIS-compatible products for visualization and further analysis. Horizontal positions, provided in decimal degrees of latitude and longitude, are referenced to the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). Vertical positions are referenced to the NAD83 ellipsoid and provided in meters. The National Geodetic Survey's (NGS) GEOID03 model is used to transform the vertical positions from ellipsoid to orthometric heights referenced to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88). Individual images have been ortho-rectified and mosaiced into boxes that extend approximately 5 km along shore. The file index is provided by the shape file, "il_boxes.shp" and the numbers used to identify files are in the "Box" field of the shape file. The data file naming convention is based on the year, project, area name, "Box" number, and product type. An example file name is "2008_NCMP_IL_Michigan_01_RGB.tif," where 2008 is the year of data collection, NCMP is the project under which data were collected, IL_Michigan is the area of data collection, 01 is the "Box" number, and "RGB" is the product type.WMS Service for RGIS dataset De Baca County 2010 Census Block Groups (84857d03-fbc6-476b-b45c-9d93dd093ce9)Overview of hydrologic unit maps adapted from USGS Water-Supply Paper 2294 giving description of hydrologic units, link to list of hydrologic units, paper maps and digital spatial data sets.The New Hampshire Hydrography Dataset (NHHD) is a feature-based database that interconnects and uniquely identifies the stream segments or reaches that make up the state's surface water drainage system. The NHHD, developed at 1:24,000 scale, is an extract from the high-resolution National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) housed at the US Geological Survey. The NHHD contains reach codes for networked features, flow direction, names, stream orders and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined on waterbodies and the approximate shorelines of the the Atlantic Ocean. The NHHD also incorporates the National Spatial Data Infrastructure framework criteria established by the Federal Geographic Data Committee.This map consists of long-term (100+ years) shoreline change rates for the lower 48 states of the United States and Hawaii. Rate calculations were computed within a GIS using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) version 4.1, an ArcGIS extension developed by the U.S. Geological Survey. Long-term rates of shoreline change for the lower 48 states were calculated using a linear regression rate based on all available shoreline data. Long-term rates of shoreline change for Hawaii were calculated using a weighted linear regression rate based on all available shoreline data. A reference baseline was used as the originating point for the orthogonal transects cast by the DSAS software. The transects intersect each shoreline establishing measurement points, which are then used to calculate long-term rates.Consistent, real-time water data from streams, lakes, reservoirs, ground-water, and meteorological sites, are available from the USGS National Water Information System as graphs, tables, or files to download.The National Agriculture Imagery Program Change 2002-2013 is a web mapping application hosted on the ArcGIS online FSA Organizational Subscription.

The information contained in the JPEG images contained in the tour was aquired from historical archives of imagery coverage at the Aerial Photography Field Office. Notation of change and highlights for each year was also derived from historical contracting sources at the Aerial Photography Field Office.Chemical, physical, profile and laboratory analysis oceanographic data were collected aboard the F. G. Walton Smith in the Gulf of Mexico from 2010-05-26 to 2010-06-02 in response to the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill event on April 20, 2010, by the Subsurface Monitoring Unit (SMU), which consisted of multiple government and corporate agencies. These data include CDOM fluorescence, Volatile Organic Compounds, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, hydrostatic pressure, salinity, sound velocity, temperature and water density. The instruments used to collect these data included CTD, bottle, fluorometer and oxygen meter along with other physical sampling devices. More specific information about each data set is located in their individual metadata records. The CTD data underwent preliminary quality assurance and control procedures at the National Coastal Data Development Center (NCDDC). This data set also contains products created for use in real time analysis and decision support. These products may include charts, graphs, maps, plots, and GIS formatted data files. The analytical chemistry data are provisional and provide results of onshore laboratory analysis of water and sediment samples. Cruise level information consisting of data management documents, cruise reports and plans, videos and pictures, and other miscellaneous documentation were gathered by the data managers. (NODC Accession 0069084)The data was created by digitizing range information from public and agency sources. These sources include OBIS the Ocean Biogeographic System (iobis.org), natural history guidebooks (National Audubon Society. 2002. Guide to Marine Mammals of the World), recovery and conservation plans, listing actions and status reports, and other agency sources. All resulting range polygons were then reviewed and approved by expert NMFS biologists specializing in the species and were finally approved by NMFS Office of Protected Resources management team. Range data include information on the range of all life stages. Offshore distances are approximate for some species as sampling and distribution information in deeper waters are often based on more limited and fragmentary evidence and studies.This dataset depicts the potential range of the species within the US Exclusive Economic Zone. Areas included may be used by only one or more life stages of the species so may not be occupied at all times or in all years or by all life stages. Common and/or other potential uses of this data set: Whenever Federal agencies authorize, fund, or carry out actions that may jeopardize the survival or recovery or affect listed critical habitat for an endangered species, they must consult with NMFS under Section 7 of the ESA. Federal agencies may not undertake, authorize or fund activities that are likely to adversely modify or destroy CH or jeopardize the continued existence of a species. If NMFS determines through consultation, that a proposed activity is likely to destroy or adversely modify critical habitat or jeopardize a species, it will work with the Federal agency to develop reasonable and prudent alternatives to the activity. These restrictions apply to those under U.S. jurisdiction in both the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone and on the high seas as well as to any project by a Federal agency worldwide. These range data may be used to help action agencies and other interested parties assess the potential for interactions with ESA listed species. The Marine Mammal Protection Act prohibits taking, possessing, or harassing all marine mammals by any person or vessel subject to U.S. jurisdiction on land, in the US Exclusive Economic Zone, and on the high seas. NMFS and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service issue authorizations to take marine mammals for specific activities including research, incidental take, harvest by native Alaskans, public display and education facilities, and stranding and emergency response operations. Other provisions apply to commercial fishery interactions with marine mammals. These range data may be useful to any of the above stakeholder groups. Effects on any of these species may also need to be considered when action agencies fulfill their responsibilities under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). These data may also be of assistance in that process. Data users can contact the NMFS Office of Protected Resources at (301) 713-1401 (Endangered Species) or (301) 713-2322 (Marine Mammal Protection Act) for further information or assistance.Location, type, mineralogy, name, and status for 900 occurrences of asbestiform minerals and fibrous amphiboles.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

The sites were discovered by water column surveys, camera tows and prior dives with a remotely operated vehicle during cruises funded by NOAA, NSF and Nautilus Minerals Inc. in the past 8 years. They range in depth from ~750 to ~2600 m. We expect to visit 10 to 13 sites during the cruise. When the ROV is not in the water we will conduct other operations including multibeam surveys (with concurrent towed magnetometer, gravimeter, ADCP, and HDSS), CTD vertical and towed hydrocasts generally at locations close to the planned targets.N/AThe purpose of the Fisheries One-Stop-Shop (FOSS) is to make fisheries dependent information readily available to fisheries managers, scientists and the American public at a national as well as regional level. Collection and management of fisheries dependent data are distributed throughout NOAA Fisheries, State Fisheries, management agencies and regional Fisheries Information Networks (FINs). The distributed nature of NOAA Fisheries information systems, differences in collection authorities and confidentiality requirements increases the importance of this flexible technical architecture that can meet the changing needs for information at national, regional and local levels of resolution. At the same time, the technical architecture is scalable to meet enterprise wide requirements for management of other types of fisheries data and fisheries independent data. Currently available via FOSS are the summarized, non-confidential, annual Commercial Landings by state as provided through the Atlantic Coastal Cooperative Statistics Program (ACCSP), the Gulf of Mexico Fisheries Information Network (GulfFIN). Recreational Landings estimates are available and provided via NMFS Headquarters. In FY2011, FOSS will be expanded to include all commercial landings nationally.The mosaic image contained in this file is comprised of several RGB images that are collected by the CHARTS system.

The DSDP was funded by the US National Science Foundation and several foreign countries through the Joint Oceanographic Institutions for Deep Earth Sampling (JOIDES), and was operated by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. The DSDP data management group at SIO compiled a full suite of computerized marine geological and geophysical data files before they were disbanded in 1987, at which time the data files were transferred to NGDC and to the Ocean Drilling Program at Texas A University for distribution.In 1989, with support from, and in cooperation with, the Joint Oceanographic Institutions, Inc., U.S. Science Support Program, NGDC produced two compact discs (CDROM) containing all computerized DSDP data. In 2000, all but the logging and geophysical data were re-released as 1 CD-ROM with an HTML interface. Data are available for free online download. In 2007, the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) transferred digital images of all core photographs and closeup core photographs in their collection to NGDC for archive. Due to their volume, these data are not available online, but are archived and available on request.

This is an Open GIS Consortium standard Web Feature Service (WFS).Snow overlays the majority of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS). However, there is very little information available on the microbiological assemblages that are associated with this vast and climate-sensitive landscape. In this study, the structure and diversity of snow microbial assemblages from two regions of the western GrIS ice margin were investigated through the sequencing of small subunit ribosomal RNA genes. The origins of the microbiota were investigated by examining correlations to molecular data obtained from marine, soil, freshwater and atmospheric environments and geochemical analytes measured in the snow. Snow was found to contain a diverse assemblage of bacteria (Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria) and eukarya (Alveolata, Fungi, Stramenopiles and Chloroplastida). Phylotypes related to archaeal Thaumarchaeota and Euryarchaeota phyla were also identified. The snow microbial assemblages were more similar to communities characterized in soil than to those documented in marine ecosystems. Despite this, the chemical composition of snow samples was consistent with a marine contribution, and strong correlations existed between bacterial beta diversity and the concentration of Na+ and Cl. These results suggest that surface snow from western regions of Greenland contains exogenous microbiota that were likely aerosolized from more distant soil sources, transported in the atmosphere and co-precipitated with the snow.

These multibeam data were collected using SAIC ISS-2000 software in the Generic Sensor Format and processed using SABER editing software. Sound velocity corrections from a Seabird SBE19 CTD sensor and motion corrections from a POS-MV vertical reference were applied to the data in real time. Predicted tides were applied to the data in real time using tide zoning and predicted tides supplied by NOAA's National Ocean Service Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS). Horizontal accuracy is 20m (no differential GPS correctors applied), vertical accuracy is depth dependent (~1% of water depth), WGS84 datum. These data are not to be used for navigation. Depths mapped range from 30 - 150 m. The AHI was deployed from the NOAA Ship Hi'ialakai and concurrent mapping was done using the Simrad EM300 and EM3002D sonars aboard the ship; metadata for HI-06-12 are submitted separately.Academic Commons SearchSummarizes the expected value over the next decade of the 3D Elevation Program for this stateUSGS geographic information studies and data for the western United States.The UK EEZPrecipitation-monitoring network for mercury in Indiana.This image represents a 0.5 meter resolution backscatter mosaic of the Mid Shelf Reef south of St. Thomas, US Virgin IslandsNOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Team, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory, federal, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data in the US Virgin Islands from 2/1/05 to 2/12/05.

Bathymetry values shallower than ~20 m were derived by gauging the reletive attenuation of coastal, blue, green and yellow spectral radiance as a function of depth. A multiple linear regression analysis of coastal, blue, green and yellow band spectral values against depth determined the variables of y-intercept, coastal,blue, green and yellow slope values. Variables then used in multivariate slope intercept formula to derive depth. Variables were adjusted to improve the statistical accuracy and spatial coverage of the final derived bathymetry product.

At the meetings, fishermen raised a number of concerns about the adequacy of walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) assessment. The issues appeared to be related to the contrasting observational scales of fishermen and National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) scientists responsible for conducting assessment surveys and population modeling. NMFS resource assessment surveys have a large spatial scale (i.e., the entire Gulf of Alaska) and occur infrequently as they are biennial summer bottom trawl and acoustic-trawl surveys, with annual or biennial winter acoustic-trawl surveys targeting key spawning areas(von Szalay, et al. 2010; Guttormsen and Yasenak, 2007; Guttormsen and Jones, 2010). The stock assessment model for pollock estimates stock abundance for the central and western Gulf of Alaska (Dorn et al., 2011). In contrast, the observational scale of fishermen is spatially restricted but temporally extensive, since they are on the water fishing throughout the year. Fishermen questioned whether NMFS assessment activities were appropriately designed to monitor the status of pollock in their area. They noted that additional surveys in different seasons and a more comprehensive acoustic-trawl survey effort in winter could help address seasonal issues such as movement between spawning and feeding areas. Cooperative research projects with the Sand Point fishing community were identified as a potential approach for addressing some of these issues, but fishermen wanted the assurance that their investment of time and effort will lead to improvements in stock assessment. The acoustic-trawl surveys described in this report resulted from collaboration between NMFS scientists, the Aleutian East Borough, and local fishermen to address issues raised during the outreach program. Acoustic-trawl surveys were conducted from a local fishing vessel in the western Gulf of Alaska during 2007-2011. To some extent, the surveys carried out during this period reflected shifting program objectives. The initial objective was simply to demonstrate the feasibility of using local fishing vessels to conduct acoustic-trawl surveys and to collect acoustic and biological information sufficient to estimate walleye pollock biomass and spatial pattern. Once this was demonstrated, the focus of the project expanded to include other objectives. It is likely that the project will continue to evolve given continued funding for cooperative research. Specific objectives of the project were the following: Evaluate the feasibility of conducting acoustic-trawl surveys of pollock using local fishing vessels. Evaluate the quality of acoustic data collected from the Simrad ES60 echosounder. Evaluate the appropriateness of the design of the current NMFS acoustic-trawl surveys in the western Gulf of Alaska. Specific issues to be addressed included 1) transect density in bathymetrically complex regions in the western Gulf of Alaska, 2) day/night differences in pollock density, and 3) temporal variability of pollock density during replicate transects. Evaluate the timing of the NMFS survey (mid-February) in Sanak Trough by conducting a survey in January prior to the NMFS survey. Evaluate relationships between adult pollock density, young-of-the-year pollock density, euphausiid density, and the distribution of foraging humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae). This report summarizes the estimates of abundance and distribution of walleye pollock in areas covered by cooperative acoustic-trawl surveys conducted aboard a fishing vessel during alternate Septembers and Januarys between 2007-2011 . It also summarizes physical oceanographic and biological composition observations, initial findings from ancillary data collections of marine mammal observations, and dual-frequency differencing techniques to discriminate different types of acoustic backscThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

Data set contains 35 individual core data sets plus time series 1746-1982 of average calcification rate for 10 of these sites. The Australian Institute of Marine Science began collecting cores from very large massive colonies of Porites on the Great Barrier Reef in the early 1980s. Such cores cannot normally be identified to species. The cores were mounted and sawn to remove slices that were about 6-7mm thick. All slices were X-rayed and skeletal density measured along a central track on each slice using a gamma densitometer. The high density portion of annual density bands in Porites from the Great Barrier Reef appears to form usually between October and March, the Southern Hemisphere summer. Peaks in the density profiles were successively counted backwards from the last (outermost or youngest) peak. Density was assumed to peak in January and the most recent peak was dated from the date of collection of the core. Dates were then assigned to all peaks in the series. Time series of the following skeletal growth parameters were then obtained: 1) Average annual density (g.cm-3) 2) Annual linear extension measured between high density peaks (cm.yr-1) 3) Annual calcification (g.cm-2.yr-1_; the product of annual average density and annual linear extension. These data were obtained from coral cores taken at 35 sites on the Great Barrier Reef. The density profiles do not always display regular, obvious annual peaks and we could not be absolutely sure of the dating for some profiles. We consider there may be errors of + or - 2-3 years in the starting data of some of these series. File AIMS10CoreAvg.txt: Time series of average calcification rate is based on 10 Porites corals for 1746-1982: Jeannie River, Flinders Reef, Brook Island, Britomart Reef, Lodestone Reef, Wheeler Reef, Havannah Island, Hook Island, Sanctuary Reef, and Abraham Reef. 3 series are presented: 1) Annual average values expressed as standardized anomalies; each of the 10 series was converted to standardized anomalies with respect to 1934-1982 mean and sd; resulting series then averaged for 10 corals. 2) Annual average standardized anomales filtered with 5-year gaussian filter. 3) Annual average series converted to original calcification units (g.cm-2.yr-1) filtered with 5-year gaussian filter. Because of potential dating errors the last two series are considered to be most reliable. Lough and Barnes (1997) suggest that ~30% of the variance in the 10-coral calcification series can be explained by variations of annual sea-surface temperature.The Ocean Data Platform (ODP) is placed on the sea floor to measure water current profiles, waves, temperature and conductivity. The ODP consists of an upward looking acoustic doppler current profiler (ADP) (SonTek/YSI ADP, www.ysi.com) and a temperature/conductivity recorder (Model SBE37-SM, Sea-Bird Electronics, Inc., www.seabird.com). This metadata record refers to the SonTek ADP dataset. ADP sensors include three acoustic transducers, internal temperature sensor (temperature data automatically compensate for changes in sound speed), compass/tilt sensor (magnetic heading and 2-axis tilt) and a pressure sensor. When an ODP is recovered, another one is typically deployed in the same place. Time series data combining multiple deployments from a given site may also be available.

GAP helps to implement the Department of Interior?s goals of inventory, monitoring, research, and information transfer. GAP has three primary goals: 1 Identify conservation gaps that help keep common species common; 2 Provide conservation information to the public so that informed resource management decisions can be made; and 3 Facilitate the application of GAP data and analysis to specific resource management activities. To implement these goals, GAP carries out the following objectives: --Map the land cover of the United States --Map predicted distributions of vertebrate species for the U.S. --Map the location, ownership and stewardship of protected areas --Document the representation of vertebrate species and land cover types in areas managed for the long-term maintenance of biodiversity --Provide this information to the public and those entities charged with land use research, policy, planning, and management --Build institutional cooperation in the application of this information to state and regional management activities. GAP provides the following data and web services: The Protected Areas Database of the United States (PAD-US) is a geodatabase that illustrates and describes public land ownership, management and other conservation lands, including voluntarily provided privately protected areas. The PADUS GAP Status Layer web service can be found at http://gis1.usgs.gov/arcgis/rest/services/gap/PADUS_Status/MapServer . The Land Cover Data creates a seamless data set for the contiguous United States from the four regional Gap Analysis Projects and the LANDFIRE project. The Raster data in both ArcGIS Grid and ERDAS Imagine format is available for download at http://gis1.usgs.gov/csas/gap/viewer/land_cover/Map.aspx .

Backscatter data are provided as separate grids depending on mapping system or processing method. The raster data file is included in "BackscatterB_7125_OffshoreTomalesPoint.zip", which is accessible from http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/781/OffshoreTomalesPoint/data_catalog_OffshoreTomalesPoint.html. The acoustic-backscatter map of the Offshore of Tomales Point map area, California, was generated from backscatter data collected by California State University, Monterey Bay (CSUMB), by Fugro Pelagos, and by the U.S. Geological Survey. Mapping was completed between 2004 and 2010, using a combination of 200-kHz and 400-kHz Reson 7125, and 244-kHz Reson 8101 multibeam echosounders, as well as 234-kHz and 468-kHz SEA SWATHPlus phase-differencing sidescan sonars. These mapping missions combined to collect backscatter data from about the 10-m isobath to beyond the 3-nautical-mile limit of California's State Waters. Within the acoustic-backscatter imagery, brighter tones indicate higher backscatter intensity, and darker tones indicate lower backscatter intensity. The intensity represents a complex interaction between the acoustic pulse and the seafloor, as well as characteristics within the shallow subsurface, providing a general indication of seafloor texture and composition. Backscatter intensity depends on the acoustic source level; the frequency used to image the seafloor; the grazing angle; the composition and character of the seafloor, including grain size, water content, bulk density, and seafloor roughness; and some biological cover. Harder and rougher bottom types such as rocky outcrops or coarse sediment typically return stronger intensities (high backscatter, lighter tones), whereas softer bottom types such as fine sediment return weaker intensities (low backscatter, darker tones). These data are not intended for navigational purposes.ROS ROS DSpace repositoryThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

The DEM is formatted as one ASCII header record (A-record), followed by a series of profile records (B-records) each of which include a short B-record header followed by a series of ASCII integer elevations per each profile. The last physical record of the DEM is an accuracy record (C-record). The 7.5-minute DEM (10- by 10-m data spacing, elevations in decimeters) is cast on the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection (the quads UTM zone can be found in the header record (Record A)) in the North American Datum of 1927. It provides coverage in 7.5- by 7.5-minute blocks. Each product provides the same coverage as a standard USGS 7.5-minute quadrangle, but overedges are published as separate DEM files. Coverage is available for all quads completely contained within New York State, plus some additional ones falling along the borders and containing significant area of the State's land.To support NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program (CRCP) long-term goals for sustainable management and conservation of coral reef ecosystems, towed-diver surveys (AKA towboard surveys) are conducted by the Coral Reef Ecosystem Division (CRED) of the NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC) as part of Pacific Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program (RAMP) Cruises. 13 towboard surveys (totaling 26.38 km in length) were conducted at Rose in American Samoa from 2010-02-17 to 2010-03-23 as part of RAMP Cruise HA1001. Towboard surveys are a good method for obtaining a general description of large reef areas, assessing the status of low-density populations of large-bodied reef fish, large-scale disturbances (e.g., bleaching), general distribution and abundance patterns of macro-invertebrates (e.g., crown of thorns sea stars, giant clams), and for assessing trends in these populations and metrics. A pair of scuba divers (1 fish diver and 1 benthic diver) are towed 60 m behind a small survey launch at a speed of 1-2 knots and a depth of approximately 15 m. Each survey is 50 min long, covers about 2 km of habitat, and is divided into ten 5-minute survey segments. The fish diver records, to the lowest possible taxon, all large-bodied reef fishes (greater than 50 cm total length) seen within 5 m either side and 10 m in front of the towboard. Length of each individual is estimated to the nearest cm. The fish towboard is also outfitted with a forward-facing digital video camera to record the survey swath. The benthic diver records percent cover of coral and macroalgae, estimates benthic habitat type and complexity, and censuses a suite of benthic macroinvertebrates including crown of thorns sea stars and sea urchins. The benthic towboard is equipped with a downward-facing digital still camera which images the benthos at 15-second intervals. These images are analyzed for percent cover of coral, algae, and other benthic components. Both towboards are equipped with SEABIRD SBE-39 temperature/depth sensors set to record at 5-second intervals. Latitude and longitude of each survey track is recorded at 15-second intervals using a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver onboard the tow boat. A layback algorithm is applied to more accurately map the position of the divers with respect to the reef environment. This algorithm calculates the position of the divers based on the position of the tow boat taking into account the length of the tow rope, the depth of the divers, and the curvature of the survey track. This metadata applies to the fish biomass observations.This project is a cooperative effort among the National Ocean Service, National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science, Center for Coastal Monitoring and Assessment; the University of Hawaii; and Analytical Laboratories of Hawaii, LLC. The goal of the work was to develop coral reef mapping methods and compare benthic habitat maps generated by photointerpreting georeferenced color aerial photography, hyperspectral and IKONOS satellite imagery. The cost effectiveness of acquisition and processing of remotely sensed imagery varies significantly between types of platforms deployed and imaging systems used to acquire the data. As a result, it is important to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the map products prepared from each of the types of digital imagery. These Accuracy Assessment point data were generated to assess the accuracy of the individual maps created from the three types of source information.Testing showed that the ability to generate benthic habitat maps with an overall accuracy of 90% to 95% confidence interval is reaching a threshold using imagery with three meter pixel size allowing for spectral enhancement of the imagery with reduced resolution. Increasing the intensity of field observation can partially compensate for this decrease in accuracy of the maps generated from the largest pixels. Habitat maps prepared from IKONOS satellite imagery should be accompanied by field observation wherever possible.WMSFile contains data presented by Shen et al. (1992a). Table includes d18O, d13C, Cd/Ca, Mn/Ca, and Ba/Ca data from a 2m coral head and, for comparison, SST records from Academy Bay (Galapagos; 0 deg 40 min S, 90 deg 20 min W). All coral measurements derive from the same samples, which were treated as described in Shen et al. (1992a). Stable isotopes were measured at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory by J. Cole and R. Fairbanks on a Finnigan MAT-251 mass spectrometer with automated Carousel-48 carbonate device; values are in standard per mil notation relative to PDB. Cd/Ca and Mn/Ca were measured at the University of Washington by G. Shen and L. Linn on a Hitachi Z-9000 multichannel atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Ba/Ca was measured at the University of California/Santa Barbara by D. Lea on a VG Elemental PQ2+ inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer. Measurement precisions are as follows: 0.08 d18O; 0.04 d13C; 9.8% for Cd/Ca; 6.6% for Mn/Ca; 1% for Ba/Ca. Ages for samples were assigned on the basis of well-defined density banding, assuming that the base of the dense band corresponds to February and that extension rates between these points are linear. Coral measurements were made at quarterly resolution. SST records were averaged from monthly resolution to quarterly based on the following 3-month groupings: Feb-Mar-April, May-June-July, Aug-Sep-Oct, and Nov-Dec-Jan.Extension, Density, and Calcification data from 35 Porites coral cores covering the entire length of the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Data set contains 35 individual core data sets plus time series 1746-1982 of average calcification rate for 10 of these sites. The Australian Institute of Marine Science began collecting cores from very large massive colonies of Porites on the Great Barrier Reef in the early 1980s. Such cores cannot normally be identified to species. The cores were mounted and sawn to remove slices that were about 6-7mm thick. All slices were X-rayed and skeletal density measured along a central track on each slice using a gamma densitometer. The high density portion of annual density bands in Porites from the Great Barrier Reef appears to form usually between October and March, the Southern Hemisphere summer. Peaks in the density profiles were successively counted backwards from the last (outermost or youngest) peak. Density was assumed to peak in January and the most recent peak was dated from the date of collection of the core. Dates were then assigned to all peaks in the series. Time series of the following skeletal growth parameters were then obtained: 1) Average annual density (g.cm-3) 2) Annual linear extension measured between high density peaks (cm.yr-1) 3) Annual calcification (g.cm-2.yr-1_; the product of annual average density and annual linear extension. These data were obtained from coral cores taken at 35 sites on the Great Barrier Reef. The density profiles do not always display regular, obvious annual peaks and we could not be absolutely sure of the dating for some profiles. We consider there may be errors of + or - 2-3 years in the starting data of some of these series. File AIMS10CoreAvg.txt: Time series of average calcification rate is based on 10 Porites corals for 1746-1982: Jeannie River, Flinders Reef, Brook Island, Britomart Reef, Lodestone Reef, Wheeler Reef, Havannah Island, Hook Island, Sanctuary Reef, and Abraham Reef. 3 series are presented: 1) Annual average values expressed as standardized anomalies; each of the 10 series was converted to standardized anomalies with respect to 1934-1982 mean and sd; resulting series then averaged for 10 corals. 2) Annual average standardized anomales filtered with 5-year gaussian filter. 3) Annual average series converted to original calcification units (g.cm-2.yr-1) filtered with 5-year gaussian filter.

Lough and Barnes (1997) suggest that ~30% of the variance in the 10-coral calcification series can be explained by variations of annual sea-surface temperature.Version 2 of the GOES Surface and Insolation Products (GSIP) is a high spatial resolution (1/8 x 1/8 degrees) solar radiation product estimated from the GOES-East and -West Imager radiance measurements hourly for the Extended Northern Hemisphere scan sector and every three hours for the Full Disk scan sector. The products contain upwelling and downwelling shortwave (0.2-4.0 micrometers) and visible (0.4-0.7 micrometers) radiative fluxes at the top of the atmosphere and at the surface, cloud fraction and skin temperature. In addition to these primary products, cloud phase, visible cloud optical depth, outgoing longwave radiation, as well as derived byproducts (composite clear and cloudy reflectances) and ancillary data (total column amounts of water vapor and ozone) are also included. Compared with the earlier GSIP-CONUS product, the new GSIP products offer an improved accuracy and higher resolution insolation data for domains covering portions of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. These improvements offer better estimates of coral bleaching and provide the high-resolution data needed for validation and forcing of Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) surface physics.The NEFSC Atlantic herring acoustic survey is a fisheries independent survey that provides scientific data for Atlantic herring assessments in the U.S. mid-Atlantic and New England regions. The survey is conducted in the fall on pre-spawning and spawning herring primarily in the Georges Bank region, but with other historical sites in the Gulf of Maine surveyed. The survey is a systematic design with parallel transects oriented perpendicular to bathymetric features. Midwater trawl sites are selected on an ad hoc basis to sample acoustic backscatter attributed to Atlantic herring as well as backscatter by other organisms. The primary gear is multifrequency Simrad echosounders, but midwater trawl, CTD, and a host of other scientific sensor data are collected ancillary to the acoustic data.These GIS files represent geographic boundaries for lands that are under the protection of NYS Agricultural District Law, administered by the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets.

The land model is a one?layer bucket water balance model, while the driving input fields are Climate Prediction Center monthly global precipitation over land, which uses over 17,000 gauges worldwide, and monthly global temperature from GHCN-CAMS (Fan and Van den Dool 2008). The output consists of global monthly soil moisture, evaporation, and runoff, starting from January 1948. A distinguishing feature of this data set is that all fields are updated monthly, which greatly enhances utility for near real time purposes. Data validation shows that the land model does well; both the simulated annual cycle and interannual variability of soil moisture are reasonably good against the limited observations in different regions.

These integrated bathymetric-topographic DEMs are used to support tsunami and coastal inundation mapping. Bathymetric, topographic, and shoreline data used in DEM compilation are obtained from various sources, including NGDC, the U.S. National Ocean Service (NOS), the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and other federal, state, and local government agencies, academic institutions, and private companies. DEMs are referenced to various vertical and horizontal datums depending on the specific modeling requirements of each State. For specific datum information on each DEM, refer to the appropriate DEM documentation. Cell sizes also vary depending on the specification required by modelers in each State, but typically range from 8/15 arc-second (~16 meters) to 8 arc-seconds (~240 meters).powered by the HUBzero(R) Platform for Scientific CollaborationHistoric Marine Geologic data reports available are from academia, government, and non-U.S. sources. These reports were originally in paper or film form and were scanned to Portable Document Format (PDF) to enable online browse/download and archive in digital form. The following are examples of the types of analyses of sediment or rock from the ocean floor or lakebeds worldwide which may be included in individual data reports: descriptions of composition and/or lithology, grain size and other physical properties, mineralogy, geochemistry, paleontology, petrology, paleomagnetism and acoustics of sediment. They may also contain low-resolution photographs of cores or dredges, or the ocean floor. Reports are searchable via the Marine Geology Digital Inventory and may also be linked to/discoverable via the Index to Marine and Lacustrine Geological Samples (IMLGS). Scanned images of most paper data reports are available to view online, however, some Copyrighted reports contributed through the World Data Center System are available for on-site inspection only. For these reports, the geologic inventory provides links to the contributing institution for ordering.IPR Holder: Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute (AFBI); Purpose: Scientific Research; IHO Sea: Inner Seas off the West Coast of Scotland - 18; Survey Start: 2007-05-18; Survey End: 2007-05-19; Primary Instrument Type: Echosounder - multibeam; Primary Navigation Type: Not Known; Information: AFBI in association with Environmental Science Research Institute (ESRI);The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Team, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory, federal, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data in the US Virgin Islands from 2/1/05 to 2/12/05. Data was acquired with a pole-mounted Reson 8101 ER multibeam echosounder (240 kHz) and processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS v5.4 software. Data has all correctors applied (attitude, sound velocity) and has been reduced to mean lower low water (MLLW) using final approved tides from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM zone 20 north, datum NAD83. The processed CARIS data was used to generate a CARIS BASE surface -akin to a DTM- based on swath angle. Within CARIS, an imagery file with associated georeferencing was then exported from the BASE surface.The project was conducted to meet IHO Order 1 and 2 accuracy standards, dependant on the project area and depth. All users should individually evaluate the suitability of this data according to their own needs and standards.Extension, Density, and Calcification data from 35 Porites coral cores covering the entire length of the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Data set contains 35 individual core data sets plus time series 1746-1982 of average calcification rate for 10 of these sites. The Australian Institute of Marine Science began collecting cores from very large massive colonies of Porites on the Great Barrier Reef in the early 1980s. Such cores cannot normally be identified to species. The cores were mounted and sawn to remove slices that were about 6-7mm thick. All slices were X-rayed and skeletal density measured along a central track on each slice using a gamma densitometer. The high density portion of annual density bands in Porites from the Great Barrier Reef appears to form usually between October and March, the Southern Hemisphere summer. Peaks in the density profiles were successively counted backwards from the last (outermost or youngest) peak. Density was assumed to peak in January and the most recent peak was dated from the date of collection of the core. Dates were then assigned to all peaks in the series. Time series of the following skeletal growth parameters were then obtained: 1) Average annual density (g.cm-3) 2) Annual linear extension measured between high density peaks (cm.yr-1) 3) Annual calcification (g.cm-2.yr-1_; the product of annual average density and annual linear extension. These data were obtained from coral cores taken at 35 sites on the Great Barrier Reef. The density profiles do not always display regular, obvious annual peaks and we could not be absolutely sure of the dating for some profiles. We consider there may be errors of + or - 2-3 years in the starting data of some of these series. File AIMS10CoreAvg.txt: Time series of average calcification rate is based on 10 Porites corals for 1746-1982: Jeannie River, Flinders Reef, Brook Island, Britomart Reef, Lodestone Reef, Wheeler Reef, Havannah Island, Hook Island, Sanctuary Reef, and Abraham Reef. 3 series are presented: 1) Annual average values expressed as standardized anomalies; each of the 10 series was converted to standardized anomalies with respect to 1934-1982 mean and sd; resulting series then averaged for 10 corals. 2) Annual average standardized anomales filtered with 5-year gaussian filter. 3) Annual average series converted to original calcification units (g.cm-2.yr-1) filtered with 5-year gaussian filter. Because of potential dating errors the last two series are considered to be most reliable. Lough and Barnes (1997) suggest that ~30% of the variance in the 10-coral calcification series can be explained by variations of annual sea-surface temperature.WellLogs in the state of CaliforniaPacific Science Center inspires a lifelong interest in science, math and technology by engaging diverse communities through interactive and innovative exhibits and programs.Discussion and diagrams on plate tectonics and the structure of the Earth for beginners with link to a detailed version: This Dynamic Earth for more information.The CLAVR-1 cloudmask (Stowe, 1999) is used to cloudmask AVHRR high resolution sea surface temperature products. The cloudmask runs a series of tests on each surface temperature pixel to determine whether the pixel is contaminated by cloud cover. Users may evaluate which specific tests in the cloudmask returned positive cloud presence results by examining the value of the cloudmask. This value corresponds to an 8 bit binary number which details which tests flagged the pixel as a cloudy pixel. See http://coastwatch.pfel.noaa.gov/info/CLAVR.html for more information regarding the specific tests used in the cloudmask.WMSHabitat maps of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands were created by visual interpretation of aerial photographs using the Habitat Digitizer Extension. Aerial photographs are valuable tools for natural resource managers and researchers since they provide an excellent record of the location and extent of habitats. However, spatial distortions in aerial photographs due to such factors as camera angle, lens characteristics, and relief displacement must be accounted for during analysis to prevent incorrect measurements of area, distance, and other spatial parameters. These distortions of scale within an image can be removed through orthorectification. During orthorectification, digital scans of aerial photos are subjected to algorithms that eliminate each source of spatial distortion. The result is a georeferenced digital mosaic of several photographs with uniform scale throughout the mosaic. Features near land are generally georeferenced with greater accuracy while the accuracy of features away from land is generally not as good. Where no land is in the original photographic frame only kinematic GPS locations and image tie points were used to georeference the images. After the orthorectified mosaics were created, photointerpreters were able to accurately and reliably delineate boundaries of features in the imagery as they appear on the computer monitor.Data available online through GeoStor at http://www.geostor.arkansas.gov.

This project is a cooperative effort between the National Ocean Service, National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science, Center for Coastal Monitoring and Assessment, the United States Geological Survey, the National Park Service, and the National Geophysical Data Center, to produce benthic habitat maps and georeferenced imagery for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. This project was conducted in support of the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force. Twenty-one distinct benthic habitat types within eight zones were mapped directly into a GIS system using visual interpretation of orthorectified aerial photographs. Benthic features were mapped that covered an area of 1600 km^2. In all, 49 km^2 of unconsolidated sediment, 721 km^2 of submerged vegetation, 73 km^2 of mangroves, and 756 km^2 of coral reef and colonized hardbottom were mapped.The goal of this project is to quantify, at the National scale, the relative susceptibility of the Nation's coast to sea-level rise through the use of a coastal vulnerability index (CVI). This initial classification is based upon the variables geomorphology, regional coastal slope, tide range, wave height, relative sea-level rise and shoreline erosion and accretion rates. The combination of these variables and the association of these variables to each other furnish a broad overview of regions where physical changes are likely to occur due to sea-level rise.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

Data are partitioned into yearly files with monthly variables, where each file contains RO-calibrated channel 7 brightness temperatures from AMSU-A measurements from NOAA-15, 16, 17, 18, 19, NASA AQUA and Metop-A. The dataset uses version 2010.2640 of the RO mission data from the UCAR COSMIC Data Analysis and Archival Center (CDAAC), the NOAA archive of the Level 1b AMSU dataset, and the NASA DAAC archive of the Aqua Level 1B dataset. The RO satellites measure the bending angle of GPS signals as they pass through the atmosphere. Temperature profiles are derived from these GPS bending angles from the COSMIC and CHAMP data from 2001 through present. Calibration coefficients are calculated from coincident measurements of AMSU channel 7 brightness temperatures and corresponding values derived from an AMSU forward model applied to temperature profile measurements from RO identified radiosondes. The monthly calibration coefficients are applied to adjust the AMSU Temperature Troposphere Stratosphere (TTS) measurements for each polar orbiter to the temperature profiles from the RO identified Radiosonde Observations (RAOBs). The calibrated AMSU measurements are then combined into gridded monthly values. From these the climatology is calculated using 12 years of data. Anomaly values are then obtained by subtracting this climatology from the monthly values.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

It is based on data from a single nearpole station, and aimed to monitor the polar cap magnetic activity generated by such solar wind parameters as the southward component of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), the azimuthal component of the IMF (By), and the solar wind velocity v. The station Thule, located in the village Qaanaaq in Greenland at 86.5 degrees geomagnetic invariant latitude, fulfills the requirement of being close to the magnetic pole in the northern hemisphere. The station Vostok at 83.3 degrees does the same in the southern hemisphere. The PC index is derived independently for these two stations. The PC-index is based on an idea by Troshichev et al. (1979) and developed in papers by Troshichev and Andrezem (1985), ennerstrom et al. (1991). Earlier data for 1975-1982 appear in Troshichev et al. (1991). The data from 1975 to the present are published in Report UAG-103, available from the National Geophysical Data Center.General permit #1 for storm water discharges associated with industrial facilities in Iowa for the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program.Pacific Science Center inspires a lifelong interest in science, math and technology by engaging diverse communities through interactive and innovative exhibits and programs.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities. Hydrographic survey data primarily consist of water depths, but may also include features (e.g. rocks, wrecks), navigation aids, shoreline identification, and bottom type information.

The answer depends on whether the areas surrounding them can allow salt marsh fauna and flora to migrate there. Local topography, both natural and manmade, is the main factor limiting this migration.A group of eight intertidal creeks with high densities of oysters, Crassostrea virginica, in North Inlet Estuary, South Carolina, USA were studied using a replicated BACI (Before - After Control - Incident) design in which all creeks are sampled simultaneously. The study known as the CREEK Project began in January 1996. Based on preliminary geomorphological observations of North Inlet creeks, by fall of 1996, eight creeks similar in size and configuration were selected for the study. Geomorphological observations were made in four stages ranging from general to detailed: 1) a general reconnaissance and the selection of the eight creeks, 2) Chris Corbett and Leroy Humphries conducted detailed survey of the internal geomorphology of the selected eight creeks using GIS equipment, 3) Leah Gregory produced a oyster reef map and oyster biomass determination, and 4) Dennis Allen measured and classified all creek bottoms (referred to as Internal Creek Habitat Survey). In January 1997, after the first three stages were complete, oysters were added or removed from each creek to equalize oyster biomass at 8 grams dry body weight per cubic meter of bank full water volume in each creek. This stage of the project is referred to as the "pre-manipulation" period where all creeks have the same amount of oyster biomass. Sampling of water and nekton began in March 1997. In February 1998, about one year after the first set of water quality, chemistry, nekton and other measurements were made, living oysters were removed from four of the eight creeks (creeks 1, 4, 5, and 8), resulting in zero dry body weight per cubic meter of water at bank full volume. This was done to investigate the role of oyster reefs in controlling levels of dissolved and particulate materials in the water and to evaluate relationships between living oysters and nekton in the creeks. During the year following oyster removal, all measurements made in the first year were repeated. The second year of the project during which four of the creeks were without oyster biomass was known as the "manipulation" stage. The BACI analysis was used to compare data between the two years. In January of 1998, the internal habitats of all eight intertidal creeks (4 in Clambank Creek, 4 in Town Creek) were surveyed manually (on foot) using tape measures during low tide. One tape was positioned along the central axis of the creek and a shorter tape was used to determine the width of the creek bottom (from the lowest points of adjacent creek banks) perpendicular to the axis. The widths were determined every one meter along the length of the main creek and each tributary. A diagram depicting the methods and morphology was created and is called "InternalCreekDiagram". A one-meter by one-meter PVC quadrat was used to determine the bottom type of every square meter of each creek. Classification was based according to 16 bottom types. Bottom sediments without living oysters were classified as soft mud, sandy mud, shelly mud, and shelly sand. Twelve other categories were based on low-density shell, medium clusters, or dense aggregates of living oysters present on those four sediment types. These data were used to generate percent values for proportions of the various bottom types. When the data were analyzed along with the other creek morphological characteristics and nekton data, the internal creek habitat categories were condensed from 16 bottom types to two bottom types: mud and shell. The creek bottom types were also divided up on the Nalgene field data sheets by their general location in the creek such as left or right fork, in a pool, and in a submerged area. External characteristics just outside the study creeks were also surveyed in January of 1998. These features also may influence the nekton entrance into the intertidal creek. Bottom types were determined for the intertidal area between the mouth of each intertidal creek and the mean low water (MLW) mark at the edge of the adjacent subtidal creek. Whereas, the distance between the mouth and MLW varied among sites, the lateral extent of the area used for this set of bottom type analyses was defined as ten meters upstream and fifteen meters downstream of the mouths of each intertidal creek. A diagram depicting the methods and morphology was created and is called "ExternalCreekDiagram". The same procedure identified for characterizing bottom area and types inside of the intertidal creeks was used for characterizing the area outside of the mouths. Like the internal creek categories, the external creek habitat categories were condensed from 16 bottom types to two.This part of DS 781 presents data for faults for the geologic and geomorphic map of the Offshore San Francisco map area, California. The vector data file is included in "Faults_OffshoreSanFrancisco.zip," which is accessible from http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/781/OffshoreSanFrancisco/data_catalog_OffshoreSanFrancisco.html. The Offshore of San Francisco map area straddles the right-lateral transform boundary between the North American and Pacific plates and is cut by several active faults that cumulatively form a distributed shear zone, including the San Andreas Fault, the eastern strand of the San Gregorio Fault, the Golden Gate Fault, and the Potato Patch Fault (Bruns and others, 2002; Ryan and others, 2008). These faults are covered by Holocene sediments (mostly units Qms, Qmsb, Qmst) with no seafloor expression, and are mapped using seismic-reflection data (see field activities S-15-10-NC and F-2-07-NC). The San Andreas Fault is the primary plate-boundary structure and extends northwest across the map area; it intersects the shoreline 10 km north of the map area at Bolinas Lagoon, and 3 km south of the map area at Mussel Rock. This section of the San Andreas Fault has an estimated slip rate of 17 to 24 mm/yr (U.S. Geological Survey, 2010), and the devastating Great 1906 California earthquake (M 7.8) is thought to have nucleated on the San Andreas a few kilometers offshore of San Francisco within the map area (Bolt, 1968; Lomax, 2005). The San Andreas Fault forms the boundary between two distinct basement terranes, Upper Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous rocks of the Franciscan Complex to the east, and Late Cretaceous granitic and older metamorphic rocks of the Salinian block to the west. Franciscan Complex rocks (unit KJf, undivided) form seafloor outcrops at and north of Point Lobos adjacent to onland exposures. The Franciscan is divided into 13 different units for the onshore portion of this geologic map based on different lithologies and ages, but the unit cannot be similarly divided in the offshore because of a lack of direct observation and (or) sampling. Faults were primarily mapped by interpretation of seismic reflection profile data (see field activities S-15-10-NC and F-2-07-NC). The seismic reflection profiles were collected between 2007 and 2010.

The information encoded about these features includes classification and other characteristics, delineation, geographic name, position and related measures, a "reach code" through which other information can be related to the NHD, and the direction of water flow. The network of reach codes delineating water and transported material flow allows users to trace movement in upstream and downstream directions. In addition to this geographic information, the dataset contains metadata that supports the exchange of future updates and improvements to the data. The NHD supports many applications, such as making maps, geocoding observations, flow modeling, data maintenance, and stewardship.

Towboard surveys are a good method for obtaining a general description of large reef areas, assessing the status of low-density populations of large-bodied reef fish, large-scale disturbances (e.g., bleaching), general distribution and abundance patterns of macro-invertebrates (e.g., COT, giant clams), and for assessing trends in these populations and metrics. A pair of scuba divers (1 fish and 1 benthic diver) are towed 60 m behind a small survey launch at a speed of 1-2 knots and a depth of approximately 15m. Each survey is 50 min long, covers about 2 km of habitat, and is divided into ten 5-minute survey segments. The fish diver records, to the lowest possible taxon, all large-bodied reef fishes (>50cmTL) seen within 5m either side and 10m in front of the towboard. Length of each individual is estimated to the nearest cm. The fish towboard is also outfitted with a forward-facing digital video camera to record the survey swath. The benthic diver records percent cover of coral and macroalgae, estimates benthic habitat type and complexity, and censuses a suite of benthic macroinvertebrates including Crown of Thorns sea stars and sea urchins. The benthic towboard is equipped with a downward-facing digital still camera which images the benthos at 15 second intervals. These images are analyzed for percent cover of coral, algae, and other benthic components. Both towboards are equipped with SEABIRD SBE-39 temperature/depth sensors set to record at 5 second intervals. Latitude and longitude of each survey track is recorded at 15 second intervals using a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver onboard the tow boat. A layback algorithm is applied to more accurately map the position of the divers with respect to the reef environment. This algorithm calculates the position of the divers based on the position of the tow boat taking into account the length of the tow rope, the depth of the divers, and the curvature of the survey track. This metadata applies to the benthic characterization observations.The Rapid Update Cycle (RUC) weather forecast model was developed by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). On May 1, 2012, the RUC was replaced by NCEPs Rapid Refresh (RAP) weather forecast model. The RUC was designed to produce quick, short-term, weather forecasts using the most currently available observations. When it was first implemented in 1994, the model was run every three hours making forecasts out to 12 hours. By 2002, the RUC was run every hour, on the hour, producing 12-hour forecasts with a 1 hour temporal resolution.

NDBC has installed approximately 50 C-MAN stations on lighthouses, at capes and beaches, on near shore islands, and on offshore platforms. NDBC has deployed over 100 moored (a.k.a., weather) buoys in coastal and offshore waters from the western Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean around Hawaii, and from the Bering Sea to the South Pacific. C-MAN and moored buoy data typically include barometric pressure, wind direction, speed and gust, and air temperature; however, some C-MAN stations are equipped to also measure seawater temperature, water level, waves, and relative humidity. Moored buoys measure wave energy spectra from which NDBC derives significant wave height, dominant wave period, and average wave period. In addition, many moored buoys measure the direction of wave propagation. In collaboration, NDBC and the National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) are archiving these data from C-MAN and moored buoys.

Due to the large file size of the 1m St. John grid, it was divided into four component grids for improved manageability, named stj04_1_1rug, stj04_1_2rug, stj04_1_3rug, and stj04_1_4rug from west to east. Rugosity is defined as the ratio of surface area to planar area and is used as a measure of benthic terrain complexity or "roughness". Rugosity values near 1 represent flat, smooth terrain, while higher values reflect increasing rugosity or terrain roughness. For rugosity grid interpretation, is is recommended that the grid be reclassified according to standard deviation divisions.NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Team and NOAA/NOS/OCS/HSD personnel, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory, federal, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data in the US Virgin Islands from 2/18/04 to 3/5/04. Data was acquired with a pole-mounted Reson 8101 ER multibeam echosounder (240 kHz) and processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS v5.4 software. Data has all correctors applied (attitude, sound velocity) and has been reduced to mean lower low water (MLLW) using final approved tides from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM zone 20 north, datum WGS84. The processed CARIS data was used to generate a CARIS BASE surface based on swath angle with footprint size 3*3. An ASCII XYZ file was exported from the BASE surface and opened in ESRI ArcMap 9 as an XY event. Then the ArcToolbox conversion tool 'Feature to Raster' was used to generate an ESRI Grid of bathymetry. The Benthic Terrain Modeller (BTM) tool, a collection of ArcGIS terrain visualization tools developed by the Oregon State University (OSU) Department of Geosciences and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Coastal Services Center, was used to calculate the rugosity of that bathymetric grid.

While various bathymetry data have been downloaded previously from NGDC, compiled, and used for a variety of projects, our effort differed in that we compared and corrected the digital bathymetry by studying the original analog source documents - digital versions of the original survey maps, called smooth sheets. Our editing included deleting erroneous and superseded values, digitizing missing values, and properly aligning all data sets to a common, modern datum. There were six areas where these older surveys were superseded by compilations of reduced-resolution multibeam surveys. We digitized 12,000 features, such as rocky reefs, kelp beds, rocks and islets, adding them to what was originally available, and creating the most thorough source (n = 18,000) of these typically shallow, inshore features. We also digitized 2,418 km of the mainland and 529 km of island shoreline, generally at a resolution of 1:20,000, and digitized 9,271 verbal surficial sediment descriptions from the smooth sheets. The depth surface, shoreline, inshore features, and sediment data sets are mostly produced at a scale of 1:20,000.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

Rugosity is defined as the ratio of surface area to planar area and is used as a measure of benthic terrain complexity or "roughness". Rugosity values near 1 represent flat, smooth terrain, while higher values reflect increasing rugosity or terrain roughness. For rugosity grid interpretation, is is recommended that the grid be reclassified according to standard deviation divisions.NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Team and NOAA/NOS/OCS/HSD personnel, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory, federal, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data in the US Virgin Islands from 2/18/04 to 3/5/04. Data was acquired with a pole-mounted Reson 8101 ER multibeam echosounder (240 kHz) and processed by a NOAA contractor using CARIS HIPS v5.4 software. Data has all correctors applied (attitude, sound velocity) and has been reduced to mean lower low water (MLLW) using final approved tides from NOAA COOPS. Data is in UTM zone 20 north, datum WGS84. The processed CARIS data was used to generate a CARIS BASE surface based on swath angle with footprint size 3*3. An ASCII XYZ file was exported from the BASE surface and opened in ESRI ArcMap 9 as an XY event. Then the ArcToolbox conversion tool 'Feature to Raster' was used to generate an ESRI Grid of bathymetry. The Benthic Terrain Modeller (BTM) tool, a collection of ArcGIS terrain visualization tools developed by the Oregon State University (OSU) Department of Geosciences and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Coastal Services Center, was used to calculate the rugosity of that bathymetric grid. More information on the specific algorithms used can be found in the BTM's documentation.While the project was conducted to meet IHO Order 2 accuracy standards, there is a roll artifact (averaging 0.5m high) in the dataset that the user should take into consideration when performing any analysis.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

NDBC has installed approximately 50 C-MAN stations on lighthouses, at capes and beaches, on near shore islands, and on offshore platforms. NDBC has deployed over 100 moored (a.k.a., weather) buoys in coastal and offshore waters from the western Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean around Hawaii, and from the Bering Sea to the South Pacific. C-MAN and moored buoy data typically include barometric pressure, wind direction, speed and gust, and air temperature; however, some C-MAN stations are equipped to also measure seawater temperature, water level, waves, and relative humidity. Moored buoys measure wave energy spectra from which NDBC derives significant wave height, dominant wave period, and average wave period. In addition, many moored buoys measure the direction of wave propagation. In collaboration, NDBC and the National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) are archiving these data from C-MAN and moored buoys. This NODC Accession is part of the collaboration and it contains netCDF (version 4) files with the data collected during January 2014.Sixty-five sampling sites, selected by a statistical design to represent lengths of perennial streams in North Dakota, were chosen to be sampled for fish and aquatic insects (macroinvertebrates) to establish unbiased baseline data.Consistent, historic, and up-to-date ground-water data, such as water levels collected at wells and springs, are available from the USGS National Water Information System as graphs, tables, or files to download.SECTIC-24K is a digital file of the Public Land Survey (PLS) section corners of Minnesota as recorded on the most recent edition of the U.S. Geological Survey's 1:24,000 7.5-minute quadrangle maps. The database attempts to best fit the section corner locations shown on the published 1:24,000 maps, even though better 'real world' data for the location of the section corner might be available elsewhere. The SECTIC-24K data set also includes a program which has the following utilities: Utility A: Section corner extraction from the SECTIC-24K database by county, 1:24,000-scale quad, or township. Utility B: Conversion among PLS, UTM, or LAT/LONG coordinates, either interactively or by file conversion. It also allows NAD27 - NAD83 conversions. Utility C: Creation of a dBASE output file from SECTIC-24K. ***This program does not run on Windows 7 - 64 bit computers (it does run on Windows - 32 bit). There is also a web service that generates much the same info as the sectic program. See http://geoint.lmic.state.mn.us/pete/pls.html . The main differences are it may not do NAD27/NAD83 shifts and it doesn't have a batch mode.

The R-factor is one of the parameters used by the Revised Unified Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) to estimate annual rates of erosion. This product is a raster representation of R-Factor derived from isoerodent maps published in the Agriculture Handbook Number 703 (Renard et al.,1997). Lines connecting points of equal rainfall ersoivity are called isoerodents. The iserodents plotted on a map of the Island of Maui were digitized, then values between these lines were obtained by linear interpolation. The final R-Factor data are in raster GeoTiff format at 30 meter resolution in UTM, Zone 4, GRS80, NAD83.WMSThese elements, abbreviated as PGE, include platinum, palladium, rhodium, ruthenium, iridium, and osmium.

Point data in ASCII text files were interpolated in a GIS to create a grid or digital elevation model (DEM) of each surface. Elevation measurements were collected in Virginia, over Colonial National Historical Park, using the NASA Experimental Advanced Airborne Research Lidar (EAARL), a pulsed laser ranging system mounted onboard an aircraft to measure ground elevation and topography. The system uses high frequency laser beams directed at the earth's surface through an opening in the bottom of the aircraft's fuselage. The laser system records the time difference between emission of the laser beam and the reception of the reflected laser signal in the aircraft. The plane travels over the area at approximately 60 meters per second while surveying the base areas of the park. The EAARL, developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) located at Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia, measures ground elevation with a vertical resolution of 15 centimeters. A sampling rate of 3 kHz or higher results in an extremely dense spatial elevation data set. Over 100 kilometers can easily be surveyed within a 3- to 4-hour mission time period. The ability to sample large areas rapidly and accurately is especially useful in morphologically dynamic areas.

The week-long expedition in 2002 was the initial effort to characterize the biology and geology of the Davidson Seamount, 1,250 - 3,700 meters deep off Central California. Many results and products from this cruise are relevant to OE, including ocean science issues, education, outreach, and resource management. The focus of the proposed 2005 cruise would be to expand on the exploratory results of our last seamount expedition to investigate processes that generated coral distribution patterns. We will use a simple model derived from results of the last cruise to test our understanding of coral distribution, and use this model to guide exploration in other regions of the Seamount (still over 99.98% unexplored.) Specific regions of the seamount will be targeted based on a topographic index, substratum type, and coral species depth records. Complementary studies of the biodiversity and population dynamics of seamount fauna will include collections of corals for taxonomic studies, and age and growth studies of corals using innovative radiometric techniques. Addressing the public interest in seamounts, corals, and exploration, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) will record imagery from Davidson Seamount to feature in an upcoming television series, co-produced with the Discovery Channel, for broadcast in the United States and internationally. The Sanctuary West Coast Visitor Center and Monterey Bay Aquarium have plans to feature seamounts and corals in future exhibits, and high-definition video imagery, as well as research findings will be pivotal in the exhibit development.Information concerning status and trends of biological resources, focusing on PlantsOffi cial web site of Pur due University s Con fu cius Insti tuteThese data are a selection of geographic and cartographic information from the 1998 TIGER/Line files detailing roads and highways.

To do this, most operating vessels use e-logbook software that allows an observer to enter information, then the software can transmit a real-time report as well as save the same report in a different format to the ship's hard drive for later access, i.e. delayed mode observation (DM). Once in port, all DM reports stored on the hard drive are retrieved and sent to the National Climatic Data Center for archiving and processing. The e-logbook software used in this dataset is the TurboWin Version 5.0 program and structures data in the IMMT-4 format.The data contained here are surface marine observations from many different sources via the NCDC Global Telecommunication System (GTS) Marine in International Maritime Meteorological Archive (IMMA) format. The observations are obtained exclusively via the NCDC GTS stream and derives primarily from ships (merchant, ocean research, fishing, navy, etc.) and moored and drifting buoys. Each report contains individual observations of meteorological and oceanographic variables, such as sea surface and air temperatures, winds, pressure, humidity, wet bulb, dew point, ocean waves and cloudiness. NCDC takes the various observations and converts the GTS data to a standard IMMA format. This allows the observations to be used in a cohesive standard for input to larger datasets, such as the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS) Near-Real-Time (NRT) product. The dataset will be produced and archived monthly. Spatial coverage is global and the current period of record for these files will begin in January 2008 to the most current month.

System Parameters/Flight Plan: The LiDAR system acquisition parameters were developed based on a maximum average ground sample distance of 4 feet. Two Leica ALS50 sensors were used for acquisition. Acquisition specifications for the two sensors were as follows: Sensor 19 Field of View (full angle) - 29 degrees Nominal flight altitude (AMSL) - 3999.30 feet Airspeed - 54.02 meters/sec Laser pulse rate - 75,000 Hz Nominal swath width (on ground) - 2068.58 feet Maximum cross track point spacing - 3.91 feet Maximum along track point spacing - 3.94 feet Average point spacing - 2.21 feet Flight line spacing - 1544.95 feet Side overlap - 25.31 percent Sensor 59 Field of View (full angle) - 29 degrees Nominal flight altitude (AMSL) - 3999.30 feet Airspeed - 60.70 meters/sec Laser pulse rate - 84,400 Hz Nominal swath width (on ground) - 2068.58 feet Maximum cross track point spacing - 3.94 feet Maximum along track point spacing - 3.91 feet Average point spacing - 2.21 feet Flight line spacing - 1413.72 feet Side overlap - 31.66 percent. LiDAR System Calibration: Prior to the LiDAR acquisition, the system underwent a calibration to verify the operational accuracy and misalignment angles. Boresight calibrations were performed for each LiDAR system at the beginning and end of each flight mission. LiDAR Data Acquisition: LiDAR data acquisition only occurred when the sky was sufficiently clear of clouds, smoke, and atmospheric haze. The LiDAR data was processed immediately after the acquisition to verify the coverage had no voids. GPS/Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) Post Processing: The GPS and IMU data was post processed using differential and Kalman filter algorithms to derive a best estimate of trajectory. The quality of the solution was verified to be consistent with the accuracy requirements of the project. LiDAR Processing and Classification: The LiDAR data was post processed and verified to be consistent with the project requirements in terms of post spacing and absence of artifacts. The point cloud underwent classification to determine bare-earth points (class 2), noise points (class 7), water returns (class 9), and unclassified data (class 1). Class 12 contains LiDAR points removed from the overlap region between adjacent flight lines. The MASSPOINT feature class contains ground (class 2) points only. To create the MASSPOINT feature class, Ground (class 2) LAS points were extracted in ArcMap, using a Woolpert Team-developed VB script, and loaded into the Geodatabase as multipoint geometry.Search Italian Online Resource on Brookes WikiThis data set contains conductivity and temperature data from the annual download of instruments on the Switchyard moored array.

The image was produced by combining the 100-meter resolution color-sliced elevation and the grayscale shaded relief data sets that are distributed by the National Atlas of the United States. The color shaded relief data were derived from the National Atlas 100-meter resolution elevation data. The elevation data were derived from National Elevation Dataset (NED) data and show the terrain of the conterminous United States at a resolution of 100 meters. The NED is a raster product assembled by the U.S. Geological Survey, designed to provide national elevation data in a seamless form with a consistent datum, elevation unit, and projection. Data corrections made in the NED assembly process minimize artifacts, permit edge matching, and fill sliver areas of missing data. More information on NED can be found at http://ned.usgs.gov.The goal of the Bonaire 2008 expedition is to survey this unique environment over a greater depth range than can be reached with compressed air scuba, using three autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), technical diving, and (in a future year) a manned submersible.This news service focuses on wildlife diseases and wildlife morbidity/mortality, especially as they relate to human and ecosystem health.This layer is the Ozark-St. Francis National Forest Special Interest Area polygons. The Ozark - St. Francis National Forests have 21 Special Interest Areas (SIA) totaling approximately 23,243 acres. SIAs are managed for their unique goelogical, botanical, biological, zoological, scenic, or cultural features. These features are unique enough that they ae not found in loarge areas anywhere on the Forests, or they provide the best representation of similar areas on the Forests. These areas are designated as SIAs because of their unique features, complexity, and degree of interest. They are managed for their unique recreational and educational values, and are intended for public use and interpretation.BoreholeTemperatures in the state of New MexicoMircWiki (en)The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

The database represents sediment variation over the study area with uncompromized (i.e., original) spatial detail. Textural data in the database are of two main types: 1) standardized statistics characterizing sample grain size distribution based on laboratory measurements (granulometric data), including percent composition by size grades (e.g., gravel, sand, mud) and size distribution parameters (e.g., mean size); and 2) sample descriptions from less exacting, more subjective visual/tactile observations, usually made in the field, establishing size-grade constituents. In addition the EBSSED database includes two descriptive fields which were each added to characterize sample grain size distribution by a single, standardized variable based on the original data. These fields classify samples according to gravel-sand-mud composition using high and low resolution schemes derived from Folk's (1954) classic ternary diagram. The high resolution scheme classifies 903 samples with detailed granulometric data into 15 textural classes, providing the greater detail regarding textural variation. The low resolution scheme (7 classes) is designed to allow unambiguous classification of nearly all samples (n=2457) including those with subjective visual/tactile descriptions. It represents the maximum number of samples according to a single common variable and thus provides the most spatially detailed data for the study area, albeit at the expense of some of the textural detail for samples analyzed in the laboratory. Overall, the EBSSED database is the most comprehensive and detailed source of information about surficial sediment textures in the EBS study area. Patterns observed in the data generally agree with large-scale textural maps and summaries by previous investigators, particularly a general pattern, with exceptions, of decreasing average grain size with increasing depth and distance from shore. However, those previous large-scale works spatially smoothed data for the study area from smaller, more sparsely distributed sets of samples. The EBSSED database preserves potentially important fine-scale variation.Search RubyGems.orgThis data set consists of land cover derived from high resolution imagery and was analyzed according to the Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) protocol to determine land cover. This data set utilized 38 three-band ADS40 scenes. These full scenes were not sufficient to replace cloud obscured areas within the base imagery. Additional imagery was used for classifying obsucred areas.

The routes are described in the National Hazardous Material Route Registry (NMHRR). The on-line NMHRR linkage is http://hazmat.fmcsa.dot.gov/nhmrr/index.asp With the exception of 13 features that were not identified with the Tiger/Lines, Hazmat routes were created by extracting the TIGER/Line segments that corresponded to each individual route. Hazmat routes in the NTAD, are organized into 3 database files, hazmat.shp, hmroutes.dbf, and hmstcnty.dbf. Each record in each database represents a unique Tiger/Line segment. These Tiger/Line segments are grouped into routes identified as character strings in the ROUTE_ID field in the hmroutes.dbf table. The route name appearing in the ROUTE_ID is assigned by FMCSA and is unique for each State [this sentence could be deleted - it doesn't add a lot to it]. The hmstcnty.dbf table allows the user to select routes by State and County. A single shapefile, called hazmat.shp, represents geometry for all routes in the United States.Large Protestant Churches in Arkansas The Large Protestant Churches dataset is composed of any type of building where Protestant Christians congregate as an organization to worship. In cases where membership or attendance figures were available, churches were selected for inclusion that had 750 or more members or attendees. In cases where such figures were not available, churches were selected based upon the population of the city that appears in their address. In this case, only churches in cities with 100,000 or more population were included. The Protestant Churches dataset should not include Non Christian, Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Russian Orthodox, Greek Orthodox and related churches of their descendants that split from the Roman Catholic church. Also not included in this dataset are homes of church representatives, schools and any type of administrative buildings. This dataset is comprised entirely of non licensed restricted data that was obtained through TGS original research. TGS has ceased making phone calls to verify information about religious locations. Therefore all entities in this dataset were verified  using alternative reference sources, such as topo maps, parcel maps, various sources of imagery, and internet research. The [CONTHOW] (contact how) attribute for these entities has been set to ALT REF . The text fields in this dataset have been set to all upper case to facilitate consistent database engine search results. Non printable and control characters were removed from all text fields. All diacritics (e.g. the German umlaut or the Spanish tilde) have been replaced with their closest equivalent English character. This was done to facilitate using this dataset with database systems that may not support such characters. The currentness of this dataset is indicated by the [CONTDATE] attribute. Based upon this attribute, the oldest record dates from 2007/09/12 and the newest record dates from 2007/11/095-MHz ground-based radar data were collected along three transects roughly follow the ice-flow direction. These three profiles are located each in slow (150-200 m/a, transect a), intermediate (150-250 m/a, transect b), and fast (300-400 m/a, transect c) -flowing regimes of the glacier. Two profiles (a1 and a2) were made for the slow-flow transect for the redundancy purpose. The data are provided in Matlab format. Each profile (a1, a2, b1, c1) has structure including: horizontal positions x and y in the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinate (meters), vertical position z above the WGS84 ellipsoid (meters), radar waveform (1024 samples per trace), corresponding two-way travel time (seconds), sampling rate of the radar waveform in nanosecond (10 nsec for this dataset), and days of the year of 2007 and seconds of the day when each radar trace is recorded. No processing is applied to the radar waveforms. However, the echo from the basal interface of the glacier and echoes from within the glacier are clearly recorded.NOAA CoastWatch provides sea surface temperature (SST) products derived from NOAA's Polar Operational Environmental Satellites (POES).

IKONOS imagery was purchased to support the Pacific Islands Geographic Information System (GIS) project and the National Ocean Service's (NOS) coral mapping activities. One-meter panchromatic and four-meter multi-spectral data were purchased for each study area. The enhanced spectral resolution of multispectral imagery and control of bandwidths of multispectral data yield an advantage over color aerial photography particularly when coral health and time series analysis of coral reef community structure are of interest. The IKONOS imagery was processed to minimize atmospheric and water column effects. Photointerpreters can accurately and reliably delineate boundaries of features in the imagery as they appear on the computer monitor using a software interface such as the Habitat Digitizer.This image represents a 0.5 meter resolution backscatter mosaic of the Mid Shelf Reef south of St. Thomas, US Virgin IslandsNOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Team, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory, federal, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data in the US Virgin Islands from 2/1/05 to 2/12/05.

During the cruise, there were 3 surveys in total conducted at REA sites around Laysan Island in the NW Hawaiian Islands. At the specific REA sites, coral biologists along with fish biologists, algal biologists and marine invertebrate zoologist entered the water and conducted a fine-scale (~300 m2) and high degree of taxonomic resolution REA survey to assess and monitor species composition, abundance, percent cover, size distribution, diversity, and general health of fish, corals, macro-invertebrates, and algae in shallow-water (< 35 m) habitats. As a part of REA surveys, the coral belt surveys were focused on quantifying the diversity, abundance, density, and size-class distribution of the anthozoan and hydrozoan corals as well as the condition and health state of the coral reef populations. The surveys were conducted along two consecutively-placed, 25m transect lines. The belt width was dictated at the beginning of each dive by subjective perceived colony density: 1-m width was used in high density areas, while 2-m width was used in low density areas. Within each 25m transect, five 2.5-meter segments were surveyed (beginning at points: 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 meters), whereby in each segment, all coral colonies whose center fell within 0.5m of either side of the transect line were identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible (genus or species) and two planar size metrics were collected: maximum diameter and diameter perpendicular to the maximum diameter. In addition, the extent of mortality, both recent and old, was estimated for each colony. Observers paid special attention to identifying as best as possible the extent of the former live colony. When a coral colony exhibited signs of disease or compromised health, additional information was recorded including type of affliction (bleaching, skeletal growth anomaly, white syndrome, tissue loss other than white syndrome, trematodiasis, necrosis, other, pigmentation responses, algal overgrowth, and predation), severity of the affliction (mild, moderate, marked, severe, acute), as well as photographic documentation and sometimes tissue samples. Tissue samples were catalogued and fixed in buffered zinc-formalin solution for further histopathological analyses. Raw survey data included species presence and relative abundance, colony counts per taxon, size (width and length), mortality, predation, and health status. A surveyed area was ranging from 10m2 to 25m2 per site.This data represents the geographic area described in Title 50 CFR Part 622.435 (a)(2)(ii), Fisheries of the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico, and South Atlantic, Subpart S Reef Fish Fishery of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, Seasonal closures applicable to broad categories of fish or to all fishing, Red hind spawning aggregation areas as of 6/27/14.GEOTRACES, An International Study of Marine Biogeochemical Cycles of Trace Elements and their IsotopesWMSBackscatter extracted from gridded bathymetry of the banktops and slope of Ofu and Olosega Islands of the Manu'a Island group, American Samoa.

The ODP was funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation and several countries through the Joint Oceanographic Institutions (JOI). In 1992, the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) placed most of the core data from legs 101-129 of the ODP onto CDROM in cooperation with NSF and JOI. The data are from an ODP relational database system in place prior to the later, JANUS, system. Not all of the data in this archive were transferred to JANUS, so some data files are unique. In 2001, the CDROM was replaced by a new version with an HTML interface, and also placed online.

Aerial photographs are valuable tools for natural resource managers and researchers since they provide an excellent record of the location and extent of habitats. However, spatial distortions in aerial photographs due to such factors as camera angle, lens characteristics, and relief displacement must be accounted for during analysis to prevent incorrect measurements of area, distance, and other spatial parameters. These distortions of scale within an image can be removed through orthorectification. During orthorectification, digital scans of aerial photos are subjected to algorithms that eliminate each source of spatial distortion. The result is a georeferenced digital mosaic of several photographs with uniform scale throughout the mosaic. Features near land are generally georeferenced with greater accuracy while the accuracy of features away from land is generally not as good. Where no land is in the original photographic frame only kinematic GPS locations and image tie points were used to georeference the images. After the orthorectified mosaics were created, photointerpreters were able to accurately and reliably delineate boundaries of features in the imagery as they appear on the computer monitor.This programs derives a table of secular change in magnetic declination for a specified point in the conterminous United States.

Towboard surveys) are conducted by the Coral Reef Ecosystem Division (CRED) of the NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC) as part of biennial Pacific Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program (RAMP) Cruises. These cruises support NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program (CRCP) long-term goals for sustainable management and conservation of coral reef ecosystems. 5 towboard surveys (10.7308 km in length), were conducted at Laysan Island in the NW Hawaiian Islands from 12 July - 17 August 2003 as part of RAMP Cruise OES0306. Towboard surveys are a good method for obtaining a general description of large reef areas, assessing the status of low-density populations of large-bodied reef fish, large-scale disturbances (e.g., bleaching), general distribution and abundance patterns of macro-invertebrates (e.g., COT, giant clams), and for assessing trends in these populations and metrics. A pair of scuba divers (1 fish and 1 benthic diver) are towed 60 m behind a small survey launch at a speed of 1-2 knots and a depth of approximately 15m. Each survey is 50 min long, covers about 2 km of habitat, and is divided into ten 5-minute survey segments. The fish diver records, to the lowest possible taxon, all large-bodied reef fishes (>50cmTL) seen within 5m either side and 10m in front of the towboard. Length of each individual is estimated to the nearest cm. The fish towboard is also outfitted with a forward-facing digital video camera to record the survey swath. The benthic diver records percent cover of coral and macroalgae, estimates benthic habitat type and complexity, and censuses a suite of benthic macroinvertebrates including Crown of Thorns sea stars and sea urchins. The benthic towboard is equipped with a downward-facing digital still camera which images the benthos at 15 second intervals. These images are analyzed for percent cover of coral, algae, and other benthic components. Both towboards are equipped with SEABIRD SBE-39 temperature/depth sensors set to record at 5 second intervals. Latitude and longitude of each survey track is recorded at 15 second intervals using a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver onboard the tow boat. A layback algorithm is applied to more accurately map the position of the divers with respect to the reef environment. This algorithm calculates the position of the divers based on the position of the tow boat taking into account the length of the tow rope, the depth of the divers, and the curvature of the survey track. This metadata applies to the fish biomass observations.This data set consists of land derived from high resolution imagery and was analyzed according to the Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) protocol to determine land cover.

Data set contains 35 individual core data sets plus time series 1746-1982 of average calcification rate for 10 of these sites. The Australian Institute of Marine Science began collecting cores from very large massive colonies of Porites on the Great Barrier Reef in the early 1980s. Such cores cannot normally be identified to species. The cores were mounted and sawn to remove slices that were about 6-7mm thick. All slices were X-rayed and skeletal density measured along a central track on each slice using a gamma densitometer. The high density portion of annual density bands in Porites from the Great Barrier Reef appears to form usually between October and March, the Southern Hemisphere summer. Peaks in the density profiles were successively counted backwards from the last (outermost or youngest) peak. Density was assumed to peak in January and the most recent peak was dated from the date of collection of the core. Dates were then assigned to all peaks in the series. Time series of the following skeletal growth parameters were then obtained: 1) Average annual density (g.cm-3) 2) Annual linear extension measured between high density peaks (cm.yr-1) 3) Annual calcification (g.cm-2.yr-1_; the product of annual average density and annual linear extension. These data were obtained from coral cores taken at 35 sites on the Great Barrier Reef. The density profiles do not always display regular, obvious annual peaks and we could not be absolutely sure of the dating for some profiles. We consider there may be errors of + or - 2-3 years in the starting data of some of these series. File AIMS10CoreAvg.txt: Time series of average calcification rate is based on 10 Porites corals for 1746-1982: Jeannie River, Flinders Reef, Brook Island, Britomart Reef, Lodestone Reef, Wheeler Reef, Havannah Island, Hook Island, Sanctuary Reef, and Abraham Reef. 3 series are presented: 1) Annual average values expressed as standardized anomalies; each of the 10 series was converted to standardized anomalies with respect to 1934-1982 mean and sd; resulting series then averaged for 10 corals. 2) Annual average standardized anomales filtered with 5-year gaussian filter. 3) Annual average series converted to original calcification units (g.cm-2.yr-1) filtered with 5-year gaussian filter. Because of potential dating errors the last two series are considered to be most reliable. Lough and Barnes (1997) suggest that ~30% of the variance in the 10-coral calcification series can be explained by variations of annual sea-surface temperature.Multibeam and singlebeam mapping operations will be conducted 24 hours a day throughout the cruise. Sub-bottom profile mapping will be conducted each day between the hours of 1000 and 2200 throughout the cruise.The mosaic image contained in this file is comprised of multiple RGB images that were collected by the Compact Hydrographic Airborne Rapid Total Survey (CHARTS) system along the coast of Wisconsin.

Specialized in-house and commercial software packages processes the imagery data into GIS-compatible products for visualization and further analysis. Horizontal positions, provided in decimal degrees of latitude and longitude, are referenced to the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). Vertical positions are referenced to the NAD83 ellipsoid and provided in meters. The National Geodetic Survey's (NGS) GEOID03 model is used to transform the vertical positions from ellipsoid to orthometric heights referenced to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88). Individual images have been ortho-rectified and mosaiced into boxes that extend approximately 5 km along shore. The file index is provided by the shape file, "2009_NCMP_Duluth_GLLWD_Vector.shp," and the numbers used to identify files are in the "Box" field of the shape file. The data file naming convention is based on the year, project, area name, "Box" number, and product type. An example file name is "2009_NCMP_WI_Superior_01_RGB_geo.tif," where 2009 is the year of data collection, NCMP is the project under which data were collected, WI_Superior is the area of data collection, 01 is the "Box" number, and "RGB" is the product type.The Northern Gulf Littoral Initiative (NGLI), Geology and Physical Properties of Marine Sediments in the N.E. gulf of Mexico: Data Report, was produced by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) with sponsorship by the Naval Oceanographic Office, in July 2001. It is report NRL/Mr-MM/7430--01-8548. Sediment cores and grab samples were collected inthe N.E. Gulf of Mexico for the purpose of categorizing the seafloor environment. This report presents results of shore-based analyses performed on the cores and grab samples. Interpretive results are not included. The unopened cores were continuously logged with a multisensor core logger, X-rayed for internal structure identification, and subsequently split open where the core material was tested for mass physical and mechanical properties. This CD data report contains spreadsheets that include: the logged data (compressional wave velocity, bulk density by gamma-ray attenuation, derived porosity and acoustic impedance), the laboratory determined properties (natural water content, undrained shear strength, and particle size distribution parameters), core and grab sample photos, and maps of the surficial sediment properties.WMSThe TIGER/Line Files are shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) that are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. County subdivisions are the primary divisions of counties and their equivalent entities for the reporting of Census Bureau data, and they include legally minor civil divisions (MCDs) and statistical census county divisions (CCDs), and unorganized territories. For the 2010 Census, the legal MCDs are the primary governmental and/or administrative divisions of counties in 29 States and Puerto Rico; Tennessee changed from having CCDs for Census 2000 to having MCDs for the 2010 Census. In MCD States where no MCD exists or is not defined, the Census Bureau creates statistical unorganized territories to complete coverage. The entire area of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas is covered by county subdivisions. The boundaries of all 2010 Census legal MCDs are as of January 1, 2010 as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS). For the 2010 Census, CCDs or their equivalents are delineated in 21 States. The boundaries of all 2010 Census statistical CCDs were delineated as part of the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP).Use MODAPS Dataset Search to obtain a list of Earth Science Data SetsBelt transects along 3 consecutively-placed, 25m transect lines were surveyed as part of Rapid Ecological Assessments conducted at 6 sites at Rota in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) in September, 2003 from the NOAA vessel Oscar Elton Sette (OES03-07). Raw survey data included species level abundance estimates.The Oahu, Hawaii Elevation Data Task Order involves collecting and delivering topographic elevation point data derived from multiple return light detection and ranging (LiDAR) measurements on the island of Oahu in Hawaii. The Statement of Work (SOW) for the area covering the northern 2/3 of Oahu was developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Coastal Services Center. A separate but related task order was issued by the USGS National Geospatial Technical Operations Center (NGTOC), under their Geospatial Products and Services Contract (GPSC), to leverage the same resources committed to the NOAA LiDAR project for the acquisition of LiDAR data in the southern 1/3 portion of Oahu. The combined task orders yielded one study area covering the entire island of Oahu. The data collected for the island of Oahu will exhibit Hydro Flattened DEMs for inclusion into the NED. The purpose of the data is for use in coastal management decision making, including applications such as flood plain mapping and water rights management. LiDAR was collected at 1.0 points per square meter (1.0m GSD) for all acquired areas on the island of Oahu.Accuracy Assessment, Observation and Plot PointsThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

Lake Superior bathymetry partially completed. The present contours and grids have been partially derived and completely compiled here at NOAA's National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) using a variety of sources of data including the NOS Hydrographic data base and the Canadian Hydrographic Service (CHS) smooth sheets. This project is a cooperative effort between investigators at the NGDC, the NOAA Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory and the Canadian Hydrographic Service. Bathymetric data used for this project have been collected from the Great Lakes in support of nautical charting for at least 150 years by the US Army Corp. of Engineers (before 1970), the NOAA National Ocean Service (after 1970), and the CHS.WMSThis data set includes data collected in 1998 to evaluate the ability of lidar to survey airport obstructions in collaboration with NOAA National Geodetic Survey. The laser emits laser beams at high frequency and is directed downward at the earth's surface through a port opening in the bottom of the aircraft's fuselage. The laser system records the time difference between emission of the laser beam and the reception of the reflected laser signal in the aircraft. The aircraft travels over the ground at approximately 60 meters per second while surveying.The data sets are generated using the OPTECH ALTM 70 kHz LIDAR system mounted onboard AeroMap's twin-engine Cessna 320 aircraft. Classified data sets such as this one may have varying posting due to some LIDAR pulses not reaching the ground caused by data anomalies. Accuracy statements are based on areas of moderate terrain. Diminished accuracies are to be expected in areas of extreme terrain and dense vegetation. The accuracy of each point is expected to meet the vertical accuracy standard; however, derived products may be less accurate in extreme terrain and dense vegetation due to a lesser number of points defining the bare-earth in these areas. The data were QA/QC'ed but some data holidays still exist. This data represents the last return data only.Report on workshop to explore a community approach to improving deterministic models of sediment transport in coastal seas, estuaries, and rivers.Submarine canyons are dominant features of the outer continental shelf and slope of the US East coast from Cape Hatteras to the Gulf of Maine. They are important conduits of anthropogenic pollutants, organic carbon, and sediments from shallow to deeper waters and support ecologically important ecosystems, such as cold seeps and hard bottom and coral habitats. The geology of these features has been well studied; however, despite their high productivity, biological data are limited (particularly deeper than 200 m). Much of the biological data available for these canyons is represented by unpublished reports, unanalyzed data sets, and anecdotal observations. The canyons between Cape Hatteras and Cape Cod are the subject of potential oil exploration, intensive fisheries, and are possible National Marine Sanctuary candidates, and yet these are even less well known than those further north.Search the current edition of the Iowa State CatalogThe search engine included in mojoPortal Content Managment SystemThis site is designed to provide information on federal interagency and cooperative developments related to coastal sand and gravel resources and management issues along the Atlantic continental margin.This map service presents spatial information for Coastal and Marine Spatial Planning.

Anthropogenic changes to the landscape, such as urban expansion, construction of roads, power lines, and other networks and land uses necessary to maintain human populations influence the number and kinds of plants and wildlife that remain. We developed the map of the human footprint for the western United States from an analysis of 14 landscape structure and anthropogenic features: human habitation, interstate highways, federal and state highways, secondary roads, railroads, irrigation canals, power lines, linear feature densities, agricultural land, campgrounds, highway rest stops, land fills, oil and gas development, and human induced fires. We used these input layers to develop seven models to estimate the total influence of the human footprint. These models either explored how anthropogenic features influence wildlife populations via changes in habitat (road-induced dispersal of invasive plants, oil and gas developments, human induced fires, and anthropogenic habitat fragmentation) or predators densities (spatial distribution of domestic and synanthropic avian predators). The human footprint map is a composite of these seven models. The final map consists of a 180 meter resolution raster data set with 10 human footprint classes.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

These values are based on point intersections of live vegetation with a sighting tube at 25 points on eight 12.6 m transects through the 0.05-ha plot. Readings were taken in the center of each habitat sampling plot and at 4 m, 8 m, and 12 m on each of the eight transects within the plot. The transects are at 45 degree increments with one transect to the north. The herb layer is vegetation < 0.5 m tall, the shrub layer is vegetation > 0.5-2.0 m tall, while the tree layer vegetation is > 2.0 m tall.Potential Evapotranspiration (PET): These data represent decadal mean totals of potential evapotranspiration estimates (mm). The file name specifies the decade the raster represents. For example, a file named pet_mean_mm_decadal_CCCMA_CGCM31_A1B_annual_2000-2009.tif represents the decade spanning 2000-2009. The data were generated by using the Hamon equation and output from CCCMA (also CGCM3.1), a third generation coupled global climate model created by the Canadian Centre for Climate Modeling and Analysis. Data are at 2km x 2km resolution, and all data are stored in geotiffs. Calculations were performed using R 2.12.1 and 2.12.2 for Mac OS Leopard, and data were formatted into geotiffs using the raster and rgdal packages. Users are reminded that the PET estimates include the inherent uncertainty of model projections. In addition, the methods used to derive PET from temperature require a number of assumptions, which future conditions may or may not meet. In particular, these methods as implemented assume that cloudcover and relative humidity remain constant. This may or may not be true. Hamon Equation: These data were derived by applying the Hamon equation as outlined in Lu et al. (2005) to monthly average temperature downscaled by SNAP.NOAA OceanWatch provides sea surface temperature (SST) products derived from microwave sensors, which can measure ocean temperatures even in the presence of clouds.

Orthophotos combine the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map. The primary digital orthophotoquadrangle (DOQ) is a 1-meter ground resolution, quarter-quadrangle (3.75 minutes of latitude by 3.75 minutes of longitude) image cast on the Universal Transverse Mercator projection (UTM) on the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). The geographic extent of the DOQ is equivalent to a quarter-quadrangle plus the overedge ranges from a minimum of 50 meters to a maximum of 300 meters beyond the extremes of the primary and secondary corner points. The overedge is included to facilitate tonal matching for mosaicking and for the placement of the NAD83 and secondary datum corner ticks. The normal orientation of data is by lines (rows) and samples (columns). Each line contains a series of pixels ordered from west to east with the order of the lines from north to south. The radiometric image brightness values are stored as 256 gray levels, ranging from 0 to 255. This dataset is a combination of all DOQ images from the State of Arkansas. They have been stitched into a single mosaic through an automated process using ER Mapper software from Earth Resource Mapping Pty Ltd. The DOQ images were contrast balanced (using histogram matching) and the resulting balanced mosaic was forced into a value range of 0 to 255 using a simple linear transformation.Library Catalog may include: Data Management Plans, Cruise Plans, Cruise Summary Reports, Scientific "Quick Look Reports", Video Annotation Logs, Image Collections, Highlight Images, Video Collections, Highlight Video Clips, Dive Plans, Dive Summary Reports, Maps, Essays, News Articles, Presentations, Education Lesson Plans, Biographies, Web Logs/Summaries.NODC Accession 0115200 includes meteorological, fish examination and biological data collected aboard the CHARTER/FISHING BOATS during cruises GP0108, GP0207-01, GP0207-02, GP0401-01, GP0401-02 and MF0310 in the Gulf of Alaska and North Pacific Ocean from 2001-07-18 to 2004-11-08.

The following is the text of the abstract provided by BCO-DMO: GLOBEC 2000: Factors Affecting the Distribution of Juvenile Salmon in the Gulf of Alaska J. Helle (NMFS/AFSC, Auke Bay Laboratory) E. D. Cokelet (Pacific Marine Environmentla Laboratory), E. V. Farley, Jr. (NMFS/AFSC, Auke Bay Laboratory), A. B. Hollowed (NMFS/AFSC), P. J. Stabeno (Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory) "Remarkable changes in atmospheric, oceanic and biological conditions have occurred in recent decades in the North Pacific Ocean including declines in the marine survival of some salmon stocks. Fishery scientists generally agree that in the first few months after leaving freshwater, salmon survival and growth are linked to oceanic variability. The purpose of this research is to focus National Marine Fisheries Service studies on the GLOBEC region, augment oceanographic measurements and determine what biological and physical factors influence the distribution of juvenile salmon. Three general hypotheses are explored in this proposal: (1) juvenile salmon prefer the buoyancy-driven Alaska Coastal Current (ACC) at the head of the Gulf of Alaska, (2) they associate with oceanic temperature, salinity, current and prey fields, and (3) they migrate landward of Kodiak Island in the ACC rather than seaward in the Alaskan Stream. Annual, summer cruises aboard a chartered fishing vessel will catch juvenile salmon on 10 transects between Yakutat Bay and Kodiak Island. The vessel will be outfitted with a thermosalinograph to measure sea-surface temperature and salinity, and with an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) - each operating continuously for fine-scale resolution. Modeled tidal currents will be removed from ADCP measurements to reveal the mean flow fields. At each trawl site, temperature and salinity profiles will provide water-column properties, and bongo-net hauls will give zooplankton distributions. Stomach samples from juvenile salmonids will be analyzed in the laboratory for diet composition and compared with zooplankton distributions. Analysis of salmon otoliths for hatchery thermal marks and Genetic Stock Identification techniques will be used to determine the home stream of hatchery and wild stocks in the Gulf of Alaska and their distribution with respect to oceanographic regimes. Retrospective analysis of catch per unit effort versus oceanographic and prey factors will reveal what affects the distribution of pink, chum, coho and sockeye salmon in the study region. Proxies for bio-physical factors will be developed and compared with salmon-run size."(project proposal) Data Collection Details: Types: CTD profiles, ADCP profiles of ocean current, juvenile salmonid catch statistics from trawls, salmonid stomach samples analyzed for diet composition, salmonid otolith analyses, Genetic Stock Identification, zooplankton distributions from bongo-net hauls Platform: Chartered fishing vessel Spatial extent: 10 transects perpendicular to the coast between Yakutat Bay and Kodiak Island Temporal extent: ~2 weeks each July-August of 2001-2004.Consistent, real-time water data from streams, lakes, reservoirs, ground-water, and meteorological sites, are available from the USGS National Water Information System as graphs, tables, or files to download.We estimated a mean of 3,500 million metric tons (Mt) of undiscovered copper among 225 tracts around the world using a geology-based assessment methodology.Orthophotos combine the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map.

The Arlindo program is a joint oceanographic research endeavor of Indonesia and the United States, designed to study the circulation and mixing of waters within the Indonesian seas. The field phase of Arlindo began in 1993 with Arlindo Mixing after many years of developing the necessary relationships and procedures with Indonesian scientists and government agencies. Inter-ocean transport within the Indonesian Seas is the primary means of exporting excess freshwater from the North Pacific Ocean. The efficiency of this transfer dictates to a large measure the meridional overturning of the Pacific and Indian Oceans and perhaps of the global thermohaline "conveyor belt" circulation . The Indonesian throughflow is relevant to ENSO as it allows "seepage" of the western Pacific's warm pool water into the Indian Ocean, adjusting the volume of the warm pool. Furthermore the regionally intense tidal induced mixing may govern to some extent the SST and sea-air coupling, with feedback on ENSO. These mixing processes enhance buoyancy fluxes, inducing locally strong upwelling and influencing the circulation pattern. Arlindo Goal: to resolve the circulation and water mass stratification within the Indonesian Seas in order to formulate a thorough description of the source, spreading patterns, inter-ocean transport and dominant mixing processes within the Indonesian Seas. Such products are used for the development of regional and global ocean circulation models; large scale coupled ocean/atmosphere models sufficient for prediction of climate and global change; understanding of the environmental conditions within the Indonesian Seas and improved understanding of the factors that affect primary productivity within Indonesian waters. Arlindo Objectives: The specific objectives of Arlindo are incorporated in each of its three phases: Arlindo Mixing (Aug 1993 and Feb 1994): to identify the source and pathways of the throughflow and to define the mixing enroute, for both monsoons. Arlindo Circulation (20 Nov-15 Dec 1996 and 17 Feb-7 Mar 1998): to resolve the throughflow transport and velocity field across the central passages of the Indonesian Seas; extend the Arlindo 1993/94 CTD/CFC coverage both temporally, to 1996/97 and regionally, to the eastern Banda Sea. Arlindo Monitoring (1998 to 2007): provide a long term data set of the throughflow to enable study at time scales of ENSO events.Microbial source tracking analysis of water sampled supports the argument that birds are the primary source of fecal contamination during the warm season.Joomla! - the dynamic portal engine and content management systemBroad overview of USGS research and monitoring designed to understand current changes in the context of prehistoric and recent earth processes, distinguishing between natural and human-influenced changes, and recognizing ecological and physical responsesOpen Data | City of Culver CityThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

Faults also teach us about crustal movements that have produced mountains and changed continents. Initially a section of Earth's crust may merely bend under pressure to a new position. Or slow movement known as seismic creep may continue unhindered along a fault plane. However stresses often continue to build until they exceed the strength of the rock in that section of crust. The rock then breaks, and an earthquake occurs, sometimes releasing massive amounts of energy. The ensuing earth displacement is known as a fault. This slide set describes the mechanism and types of faulting. It illustrates a variety of fault expressions in natural and manmade features.News and related information focusing on the importance of wildfire hazards in the United States.This metadata is for the 2005 vegetation data points (spatial database) created from the sample vegetation plots collected at Washita Battlefield National Historic Site.The Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences (ATOC) at the University of Colorado at Boulder is located in a region having the greatest concentration of geophysical researchers in the nation and perhaps the world. The proximity of ATOC to this atmospheric and oceanic science ground zero \\x7f is the foundation of our unique philosophy and vision, which elevates our department to one of worldwide prominence. The guiding principle of ATOC is to be the focal point for atmospheric and oceanic science education and research training in this geographic region of world-renown excellence. ATOC is an interdisciplinary program that provides an educational and research environment to examine the dynamical, physical, and chemical processes that occur in the atmosphere and the ocean. A major theme is the establishment of a physical basis for understanding, observing, and modeling climate and global change.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the statutory mandate to collect hydrographic data in support of nautical chart compilation for safe navigation and to provide background data for engineers, scientific, and other commercial and industrial activities.

Law Enforcement agencies "are publicly funded and employ at least one full-time or part-time sworn officer with general arrest powers". This is the definition used by the US Department of Justice - Bureau of Justice Statistics (DOJ-BJS) for their Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics (LEMAS) survey. Although LEMAS only includes non Federal Agencies, this dataset includes locations for Federal, state, local, and special jurisdiction law enforcement agencies. Law Enforcement agencies include, but are not limited to, municipal police, county sheriffs, state police, school police, park police, railroad police, federal law enforcement agencies, departments within non law enforcement federal agencies charged with law enforcement (e.g. US Postal Inspectors), and cross jurisdictional authorities (e.g. Port Authority Police). Although TGS' intention is to only include locations associated with agencies that meet the above definition, TGS has discovered a few locations that are associated with agencies that are not publicly funded. TGS is deleting these locations as we become aware of them, but some probably still exist in this dataset. Generally the requirements and training for becoming a sworn law enforcement officer are set by each state. Law Enforcement agencies themselves are not chartered or licensed by their state. County, city and other government authorities within each state are generally empowered by their state law to setup or disband Law Enforcement agencies. Never the less, the agencies have visibility to state level authorities because generally sworn Law Enforcement officers must report to the state the agency they are employed by. TGS did not verify any state attributes, only the name, physical street address, city, state, five digit zip code, phone number and location were verified through phone contact. At the request of NGA, text fields in this dataset have been set to all upper case to facilitate consistent database engine search results.

Rugosity is defined as the ratio of surface area to planar area and is used as a measure of benthic terrain complexity or "roughness". Rugosity values near 1 represent flat, smooth terrain, while higher values reflect increasing rugosity or terrain roughness. For rugosity grid interpretation, is is recommended that the grid be reclassified according to standard deviation divisions.NOAA's NOS/NCCOS/CCMA Biogeography Team, in collaboration with NOAA vessel Nancy Foster and territory, federal, and private sector partners, acquired multibeam bathymetry data in the US Virgin Islands from 2/1/05 to 2/12/05.

Data set contains 35 individual core data sets plus time series 1746-1982 of average calcification rate for 10 of these sites. The Australian Institute of Marine Science began collecting cores from very large massive colonies of Porites on the Great Barrier Reef in the early 1980s. Such cores cannot normally be identified to species. The cores were mounted and sawn to remove slices that were about 6-7mm thick. All slices were X-rayed and skeletal density measured along a central track on each slice using a gamma densitometer. The high density portion of annual density bands in Porites from the Great Barrier Reef appears to form usually between October and March, the Southern Hemisphere summer. Peaks in the density profiles were successively counted backwards from the last (outermost or youngest) peak. Density was assumed to peak in January and the most recent peak was dated from the date of collection of the core. Dates were then assigned to all peaks in the series. Time series of the following skeletal growth parameters were then obtained: 1) Average annual density (g.cm-3) 2) Annual linear extension measured between high density peaks (cm.yr-1) 3) Annual calcification (g.cm-2.yr-1_; the product of annual average density and annual linear extension. These data were obtained from coral cores taken at 35 sites on the Great Barrier Reef. The density profiles do not always display regular, obvious annual peaks and we could not be absolutely sure of the dating for some profiles. We consider there may be errors of + or - 2-3 years in the starting data of some of these series. File AIMS10CoreAvg.txt: Time series of average calcification rate is based on 10 Porites corals for 1746-1982: Jeannie River, Flinders Reef, Brook Island, Britomart Reef, Lodestone Reef, Wheeler Reef, Havannah Island, Hook Island, Sanctuary Reef, and Abraham Reef. 3 series are presented: 1) Annual average values expressed as standardized anomalies; each of the 10 series was converted to standardized anomalies with respect to 1934-1982 mean and sd; resulting series then averaged for 10 corals. 2) Annual average standardized anomales filtered with 5-year gaussian filter. 3) Annual average series converted to original calcification units (g.cm-2.yr-1) filtered with 5-year gaussian filter. Because of potential dating errors the last two series are considered to be most reliable. Lough and Barnes (1997) suggest that ~30% of the variance in the 10-coral calcification series can be explained by variations of annual sea-surface temperature.Search Bookworks, Printing and Printmaking on Brookes WikiGEOTRACES, An International Study of Marine Biogeochemical Cycles of Trace Elements and their IsotopesAccess to GIS geospatial datasets for Oklahoma and the United States for Geographic Information Systems (GIS) applications.This dataset contains a GeoTIFF with 2x2 meter cell size representing the bathymetry of a selected portion of seafloor south of St. thomas, USVI, derived from data collected from 3/28/2011 to 4/14/2011.

Backscatter data are provided as separate grids depending on mapping system or processing method. The raster data files is included in "BackscatterA_8101_2004_OffshoreBolinas.zip", which are accessible from http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/781/OffshoreBolinas/data_catalog_OffshoreBolinas.html. The acoustic-backscatter map of the Offshore of Bolinas map area, California, was generated from backscatter collected by California State University, Monterey Bay (CSUMB), by Fugro Pelagos, and by Moss Landing Marine Laboratory (MLML). Mapping was completed between 2004 and 2010, using a combination of 200-kHz and 400-kHz Reson 7125, and 244-kHz Reson 8101 multibeam echosounders, as well as 468-kHz SEA SWATHPlus and 250-kHz GeoSwath interferometric systems. Moss Landing Marine Laboratory mapped the nearshore region north of Bolinas in 2004 prior to the California Seafloor Mapping Program (CSMP). The nearshore region from south of Bolinas Lagoon to Stinson Beach was mapped by Fugro Pelagos in 2009 for a project outside of the CSMP and only bathymetry data were collected. Therefore, note that the shaded relief map coverage (see Bathymetry Hillshade--Offshore of Bolinas, California, DS 781) does not match the acoustic-backscatter map coverage (see Backscatter A-E--Offshore of Bolinas, California, DS 781). Within the acoustic-backscatter imagery, brighter tones indicate higher backscatter intensity, and darker tones indicate lower backscatter intensity. The intensity represents a complex interaction between the acoustic pulse and the seafloor, as well as characteristics within the shallow subsurface, providing a general indication of seafloor texture and sediment type. Backscatter intensity depends on the acoustic source level; the frequency used to image the seafloor; the grazing angle; the composition and character of the seafloor, including grain size, water content, bulk density, and seafloor roughness; and some biological cover. Harder and rougher bottom types such as rocky outcrops or coarse sediment typically return stronger intensities (high backscatter, lighter tones), whereas softer bottom types such as fine sediment return weaker intensities (low backscatter, darker tones). These data are not intended for navigational purposes.During the Okeanos Explorer (EX) mission EX1204, the vessel will sail from Norfolk, VA, along the continental shelf break of the U.S. East Coast from Virginia to Rhode Island, to the ship s home port of Davisville, RI.

The maps are part of a worldwide series of maps on CD-ROM released by the U.S. Geological Survey's World Energy Project. The goal of the project is to assess the undiscovered, technically recoverable oil and gas resources of the world. For data management purposes the world was divided into eight energy regions corresponding approximately to the economic regions of of the world as defined by the U.S. Department of State. Europe (Region 4) includes Albania, Andorra, Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Malta, Monaco, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, San Marino, Serbia and Montenegro, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom and Vatican. The depicted portion of Region 2 includes Turkey. Each region is divided into geologic provinces. Each province has a set of geologic characteristics that distinguish it from surrounding provinces. These characteristics may include the predominant lithologies, the age of the strata, and the structural style. Some provinces include multiple genetically-related basins. Geologic province boundaries are delineated using data from a number of geologic maps and other tectonic and geographic data (see References). Offshore province boundaries are defined by the 2000 meter bathymetric contour. Each province is assigned a unique number. Because geologic trends are independent of political boundaries, some provinces overlap two regions. The code of those provinces that lie entirely within Europe begin with the number 4 and those provinces that lie entirely within Turkey begin with the number 2. The code of those provinces that lie partly within another region may start with a 1, for the Former Soviet Union (Persits and others 1998) or a 2, for Middle East and North Africa (Pollastro , 1998; Persits and others, 1997). The centerpoint locations of oil and gas fields are plotted based on the locations in the Petroconsultants International Data Corp. (1996) database with permission. Selected provinces are currently being investigated, by Total Petroleum System analysis, and assessments are being made of the undiscovered oil and gas resource potential of these provinces. Klett and others (1997) discuss the worldwide geologic provinces and their relative ranking in terms of total known petroleum volume. Specific details of the data sources and map compilation are given in the metadata files on this CD-ROM. Some stratigraphic units are combined to simplify the map and to ensure consistency across the region. All rocks are colored by age.

Historically studied as isolated environments, scientists made discoveries that helped link these deep water communities (or "islands") that lie beneath the Yucatan, Loop and Gulf Stream currents (i.e., the 'stream'). The voyage also helped to document pieces of our maritime heritage and engaged the public through numerous education and outreach events. Islands in the Stream was a three-month scientific expedition to marine protected areas and other habitats being considered for protection from offshore of Belize in Central America to North Carolina's continental shelf. 'Islands' are the coral reefs and hard-bottom (also called 'hard substrate') biological communities found along the course of a massive "stream" of ocean currents connecting the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, and the western Atlantic off North America. This expedition emphasized habitat characterization and an understanding of these islands' 'connection' as parts of an interrelated ecosystem. Though separated by large expanses of ocean water, the fishes, corals, and invertebrates common to these islands demonstrated that the health and vitality of "downstream" islands are linked closely to those located 'upstream.' The expedition was conducted in two major segments: The Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico Expedition (from Belize to the Dry Tortugas at the tip of the Florida Keys) and the South Altantic Bight Expedition (from Oculina Bank Reserve, off Florida's Atlantic Coast, to three sites off the North Carolina continental.The Global Historical Tsunami Database provides information on over 2,400 tsunamis from 2100 BC to the present in the the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans; and the Mediterranean and Caribbean Seas. The database includes two related files. The first file includes information on the tsunami source such as the date, time, and location of the source event; cause and validity of the source, tsunami magnitude and intensity; maximum water height; the total number of fatalities, injuries, houses destroyed, and houses damaged; and total damage estimate (in U.S. dollars). The second related file contains information on the runups (the locations where tsunami waves were observed by eyewitnesses, reconnaissance surveys, tide gauges, and deep-ocean sensors) such as name, location, arrival time, maximum water height and inundation distance, and socio-economic data (deaths, injuries, damage) for the specific runup location.The National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) established the Coastal-Marine Automated Network (C-MAN) for the National Weather Service in the early 1980's. NDBC has installed approximately 50 C-MAN stations on lighthouses, at capes and beaches, on near shore islands, and on offshore platforms. NDBC has deployed over 100 moored (a.k.a., weather) buoys in coastal and offshore waters from the western Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean around Hawaii, and from the Bering Sea to the South Pacific. C-MAN and moored buoy data typically include barometric pressure, wind direction, speed and gust, and air temperature; however, some C-MAN stations are equipped to also measure seawater temperature, water level, waves, and relative humidity. Moored buoys measure wave energy spectra from which NDBC derives significant wave height, dominant wave period, and average wave period. In addition, many moored buoys measure the direction of wave propagation. In collaboration, NDBC and the National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) are archiving these data from C-MAN and moored buoys. This NODC Accession is part of the collaboration and it contains netCDF (version 4) files with the data collected during January 2012.Information on vertebrate fossils and their use in paleontologic research in biostratigraphy, paleoclimatology, paleobiology, paleoecology, and earth history.The potentially exploitable geothermal energy reserves associated with an active or dormant volcano can be estimated using a methodology that combines principles of conductive heat transfer and volcanology to calculate temperature distribution in time and space following magma emplacement, then calculates recoverable geothermal reserves using principles of thermodynamics combined with reasonable values for rock and fluid properties and recovery and utilization factors. Four principal magma characteristics must be estimated for the calculation: volume, depth, age and temperature of emplacement. Since these four parameters and the recovery factor are the most important uncertain parameters in the reserve calculation, a probabilistic simulation is done by assigning to each a reasonable maximum and a reasonable minimum value and a probability distribution - usually triangular (if a most-likely value can be defined) or uniform (all values between the minimum and maximum being equally likely). The mean, standard deviation and most-likely values of reserves are then calculated statistically through Monte Carlo sampling of the uncertain parameters. The bases for assigning these maximum and minimum values are discussed, and an example of application of this methodology to a volcano in Nicaragua is presented. In a nationwide assessment of geothermal prospects in Nicaragua, this methodology has been applied to 14 different volcanoes, ranging in volume from 4 to 220 cubic km, depth from 3 to 7 km, age from 5,000 to 500,000 years, and temperature from 900C to 1,100C. With a uniform distribution of 0.05 to 0.1 for the recovery factor, and a typical utilization factor of 45%, the mean calculated reserves per volcano ranged from 61 MW to 676 MW for 30 years. In the absence of detailed exploration and drilling, this methodology provides a perfectly general, rigorous and internally consistent method of geothermal reserves estimation in the volcanic environment.The data include a full year of logbook forms for vessels 60-124 feet in length (the partial coverage fleet) that had participated in the trawl flatfish fishery of 2005 in the Gulf of Alaska. The digitized hauls were not restricted exclusively to the population of trips to the Gulf of Alaska (GOA), since some vessels also participated in BSAI trawl fisheries. A total of 55 unique vessels daily fishing logbooks (9 catcher-processors and 46 catcher vessels) were digitized into the Vessel Log System database. The daily production section for catcher-processors was not digitized, therefore they were excluded from the data entry procedure and we focus on the remaining catcher vessels. These logbook records are then combined with observer and fish ticket data for the same vessels to create a more complete accounting of each vessels activity in 2005. In order to examine the utility, uniqueness, and the congruence of data contained in the logbooks with other sources, we collated vessel records from logbook data with Alaska Commercial Fisheries Entry Commission (CFEC) fish tickets (retrieved from the Alaska Fisheries Information Network (AKFIN)) and the North Pacific Groundfish Observer Program observer records. Merging of datasets was a multiple-step process. The first merge of data was between the quality-controlled observer and fish ticket data. Prior to 2007, the observer program did not track trip-level information such as the date of departure and return to/from port, or landing date. Consequently, to combine the 2005 haul-level observer data with the trip-level data from the fish tickets for a given vessel, each observer haul was merged with a fish ticket record if the haul retrieval date from the observer data was contained within in the modified start and end date derived from the fish ticket data (see above). Since the starting date on the fish ticket record represents the date fishing began, rather than the date a vessel left port, all observer haul records should be within the time frame of the fish ticket start and end dates. The observer hauls were therefore given the same trip number as determined by the fish tickets trip numbering algorithm. The same process was then repeated to merge each logbook haul onto the combined fish ticket and observer data. Trip targets were then assigned from the North Pacific Fishery Management Council comprehensive observer database (Council.Comprehensive_obs) for observed trips, and statistical areas denoted on the fish tickets were mapped to Fishery Management Plan (FMP) areas. After quality control, the dataset was considered complete, and is referred to as the combined dataset.Use Google to search the George A.
